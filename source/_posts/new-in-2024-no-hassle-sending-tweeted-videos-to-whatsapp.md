With the increasing popularity of the already popular messaging app 'WhatsApp,' users tend to share everything using WhatsApp, be it links, documents, music, or videos of any sort. It has now come to this point that even videos and links from other social media platforms are also being shared using WhatsApp.

In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.

## Send a Twitter Video to WhatsApp with Link

Below are the steps you can follow if you want to send a Twitter video via WhatsApp using the link.
