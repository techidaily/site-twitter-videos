**Step 1:** From the left section, the first tab is "Account," which will explain all the account details for you. Through this tab, you can explore the following options:

* Tap ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù to see your profile details at the time you requested the archive file. This would comprise all the followers and the followings that the account would have at the download request.
* Tap ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù to check the list of contacts to whom you have uploaded across Twitter from the phone or the device that you‚Äôve connected with the platform.
* Tap ‚ÄúConnected Applications‚Äù to see all the applications you have given access to to access data from Twitter.
* Tap ‚ÄúSessions‚Äù to check the apps that have accessed your account at different instances.
* Tap ‚ÄúAccount Access History‚Äù to evaluate all of your login histories across Twitter.
