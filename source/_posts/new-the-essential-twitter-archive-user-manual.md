**Step 5:** The “Ads” tab will display all the advertisements Twitter has shown to you. By clicking on an ad, you can find its target audience and will also contain the reason why it was displayed to you. Another tab is "Lists," and by clicking on it, you will find the Twitter lists you have ever subscribed to or created.
