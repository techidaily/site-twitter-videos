As you would have speculated, the aspect ratio can also be used regarding pictures; however, since we're discussing the video in this article, we won't deviate to incorporating the aspect ratio for the image.

● The aspect ratio is written as x:y.

The 1st number of the aspect ratio refers to the width, while the 2nd number of the aspect ratio refers to the height of the video.

The videos on Twitter have become the most used content in recent years. The best aspect ratio that should be used in Twitter for videos is 1:2.39 and 2.39:1\. You have to make sure that you should go for a higher aspect ratio for videos. Opting higher aspect ratio makes your videos take up more space the engagement of the videos depends upon the visibility of the videos. The higher the visibility, the higher will be the engagement.

Twitter recommends two aspect ratios for twitter videos.

● For landscape or portrait, it recommends 16:9.

For square, it recommends 1:1.

### 1\. Keep it short and simple

Currently, the world is moving fast; therefore, humans can get distracted instantly, grabbing their attention is easy. But if you want to get the real deal, you'll need to make the initial part of your video attractive enough for them to wait and watch the other part of the video.

The first 3 seconds of your video should always carry the main message you intended to share. Also, try as much as possible to make videos in less than 15 seconds to maximize branding impact.

Employ the same strategy for your tweet copy and try to keep it concise and crisp and stay below 100 characters.

### 7\. Engage More Than You Broadcast

Brands have forgotten that Twitter is a social network but not a marketing tool in some cases. As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.

However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.

### 7\. Engage More Than You Broadcast

Brands have forgotten that Twitter is a social network but not a marketing tool in some cases. As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.

However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.

### Conclusion

There are approximately 330 million active users on Twitter each month; with such a big number, your organic post might easily get lost in the crowd. So, selling video ads as an investment should consider getting your brand to the next level. On the other hand, ensure that you follow all the required video specifications for each Twitter video. This is because the last thing you want is an attractive video that cannot be posted. After all, it has the wrong aspect ratio for Twitter video or wrong Twitter video file size. In this case, you need Filmora to resize your videos easily.
