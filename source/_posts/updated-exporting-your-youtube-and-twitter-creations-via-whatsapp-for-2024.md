## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality options to choose from. Various quality options are available, including 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality. The size of the download file varies with the quality. The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.

## Step 4: Share it on WhatsApp
