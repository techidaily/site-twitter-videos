1. #### Twitter Video Format

One of the most important aspects to consider while fixing this problem is checking if the video that is not being played has the correct format. Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn't have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.

1. #### Flash for Twitter

If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the 'Lock' icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to 'Site Settings.'

This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos. If this was the reason behind the Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, allowing flash will solve this problem.

1. #### Clear Cookies and Cache

1. #### Update your Browser

Are you still facing the same problem with Twitter videos after all the changes? Then the last thing you should try is to update your browser. If you are running an outdated version of Chrome, it might hinder the videos from playing. In addition, the outdated version can make your browser incompatible with Twitter videos. You can quickly check if your browser is an updated version of Chrome or not by clicking on the three dots on the top right corner of the browser. If it shows you an option to update your browser, you are running an outdated Chrome version. Therefore, you should update it as soon as possible to fix all the problems related to it, including playing Twitter videos.

All the above methods are tested and proven to fix Twitter videos not playing in Chrome by many users. All these methods can be applied easily to your browser and don't need technical skills or expertise. Check all the ways to see which method works best for you.
