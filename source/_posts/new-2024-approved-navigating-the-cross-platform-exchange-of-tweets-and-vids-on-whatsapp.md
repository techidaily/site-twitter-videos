Below are the steps you can follow if you want to send a Twitter video via WhatsApp using the link.

With the increasing popularity of the already popular messaging app 'WhatsApp,' users tend to share everything using WhatsApp, be it links, documents, music, or videos of any sort. It has now come to this point that even videos and links from other social media platforms are also being shared using WhatsApp.

In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.

## Send a Twitter Video to WhatsApp with Link

Most people who use Twitter do not tend to open their Direct Messages often because there are not many features in the Twitter application related to messages. Well, it is more of a public app meant for sharing Tweets and not messages.

Suppose you need to share something with your friends or anyone else. In that case, the wisest way to do so is to send them a link on a messaging platform almost everyone uses. Yes, you guessed it right, that messaging application is WhatsApp.

Below are the steps you can follow if you want to send a Twitter video via WhatsApp using the link.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter account using your credentials if you are not already logged in.
