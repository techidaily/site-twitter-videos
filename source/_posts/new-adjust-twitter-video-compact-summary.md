## Tips and Tricks to Make A Good Twitter Video Thumbnail

To help you choose the best thumbnail for your Twitter videos, here are some tips and tips to ensure you choose the right thing and get the best out of your thumbnail

### Tip no 1: Use Still Images

It is always good to use a still image rather than a screenshot or a frame from within the video itself. It might be blurry and out of context and may not complement its relevance to the video. You can always capture a separate photo while filming the video or create a digital graphic while editing.

### Tip no 2: Be Minimal

Overdoing anything kills its purpose and appeal. It should be catchy but do not cram too much information into the thumbnail. Do not include an overly crowded photo or out-of-context things; it will take away the essence of your context. You can add simple graphics or photos and text that best describes your video's primary purpose or topic.

### Tip no 3: Visible text

Make sure the text that you add to your thumbnail is appropriately visible. Its contrast is set such that the text does not blend in with the background but stands out from it. Hence, it is easily readable and does not create a light effect resulting in the audience skipping your video.

### Tip no 4: Size

The dimensions of your thumbnail photo should be as such that they are compatible with all screen sizes as different users will watch the video on different devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc., so you should not crop out the thumbnail in any way.

### Tip no 5: Use a face

It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object. You can always use a face to catch your audience's attention, but make sure the face is related to the video and does not misguide anyone regarding the topic and context of your video.

### Tip no 6: Editing and Color Scheme

Always edit and treat the thumbnail photo beforehand. It should be catchy and compliment the content of the video. Be careful while choosing the color scheme of your photo; you can use a similar color palette as your video, or you can use colors in contrast to the theme of your video. It should not look alien in any way.

## Conclusion

These are all the things you need to know about how to add thumbnails to Twitter videos how to change thumbnails. Those are things that can help you create an attractive thumbnail for your videos. Follow the steps mentioned above, and you will not have to worry about anything else.

The tips and tricks can be beneficial if you create the thumbnails accordingly. The results will be visible soon in the shape of a greater reach, a wider audience, and increasingly high views and like count. Good luck!
