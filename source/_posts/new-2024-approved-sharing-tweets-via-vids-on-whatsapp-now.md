## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Well, you learned all the steps revolving around how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not have Twitter? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else. Still, you cannot embed it with the link.
