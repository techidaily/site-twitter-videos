### 7\. [Subway work collapse](https://twitter.com/fala%5Fbrasil/status/1488493502153515009?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488493502153515009%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fvideos.trends24.in%2F)

The video is a recording of the horrific moment when a section of the asphalt collapsed right next to where the subway work is going on. It happened early in the morning so there was no traffic on the road and no harm occurred. However, the express lane was later opened for traffic after the completion of repair work. Instances like these are rarely captured as they’re happening, so it’s no surprise why this video is trending on Twitter.

### 8\. [A meme take on racism in NFL coach hiring](https://twitter.com/KingJosiah54/status/1488637258315878401?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488637258315878401%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fvideos.trends24.in%2F)

A video trending on Twitter shared by Josiah Johnson is a meme-based take on the recent allegations made by American football coach Brian Flores. He said that there’s a factor of racism involved in the hiring process of NFL coaches. He has filed a lawsuit against the NFL, claiming bias in the coaching search. The video is only 1 second long.

### 9\. [A meme video to tease New England Patriots fans](https://twitter.com/brgridiron/status/1488526485262675970?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488526485262675970%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fvideos.trends24.in%2F)

It’s a video of a crying baby who is assumed to be a New England Patriots fan. Tom Brady played in 20 NFL seasons for New England Patriots and later joined Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He recently announced retirement but didn’t mention patriots fans in the retirement speech. The meme in the video depicts that Patriots fans must be crying and disheartened because Tom Brady didn’t pay any gratitude to them.
