## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality to choose from. There are various quality options available that include 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality, and the size of the download file varies with the quality.

The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter. Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it on Snapchat.

## Step 4: Share it on Snapchat

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up Snapchat, swipe up from the main screen to the camera roll, press and hold on to the video you have downloaded, and select send snap. It will then take you to the contacts list to send the video to any individual group or upload it to your story.

## Conclusion

It can be a hassle if your friends do not use the same social media platforms as you do or if sharing videos on the same social media platforms is an issue. You cannot just take a screenshot and send it to anyone as it is a video, and video sharing does not work like that. But we have got you.

Now that you know all methods of sharing Twitter Videos on Snapchat, with or without the link, follow the steps mentioned above, and it will save you and your friends from the nuisance caused by inter-platform video sharing.
