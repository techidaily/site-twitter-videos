It’s a 4 minutes long video on Tom Brady’s career. It tells when did he start to play American football. It’s an amazingly edited compilation of his best moments and shows what makes him the greatest quarterback in the history of American football.

The video is a recording of the horrific moment when a section of the asphalt collapsed right next to where the subway work is going on.
