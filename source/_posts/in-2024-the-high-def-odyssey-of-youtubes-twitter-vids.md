## Reasons Why Twitter HD Videos Not Playing

Sometimes, Twitter HD videos stop playing in the mobile application or in your browser. The reasons behind this happening have been enlisted below:

**Network Issue**

The issue of network connection is the major issue behind the improper functionality of the Twitter app. When the internet connection is slow, Twitter does not let you watch HD videos because they are high in quality and require fast speed internet connection.

You should also check the signal strength of your network from the connectivity settings. You can also switch towards another network that has strong signal strengths.

**Cache and Cookies of the Browser**

Twitter HD videos may not be played because of the cache data and cookies in your browser. You need to clear the cache of your application by clicking on Settings < Appa < Twitter < Clear Cache. You can also delete it from the browser if you are using Twitter on Chrome.

**Plugins’ Security Software**
