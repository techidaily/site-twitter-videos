Twitter is an internationally renowned online news and social networking platform. Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the **best video format for Twitter** is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform's promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for **Twitter format videos** are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, **uploading videos on Twitter iOS** and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.

Part 1: [Best Video Formats for Twitter](#step1)

Part 2: [How to post videos on Twitter?](#step2)

## Part 1\. Best Video Formats for Twitter

In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter's trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by **uploading videos on Twitter** from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There's no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.

Otherwise, you won't be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don't fulfill the social media platform's minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280\. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.

**1\. Twitter's Best Video Format**

Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.

 **There is a video duration restriction on Twitter**

Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.

If you're using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you'll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.

**3\. The maximum size of a video on Twitter**

You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.

**4\. The maximum video resolution on Twitter**

32 Ã— 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.

1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)

**5\. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited**.

For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1

**6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter**

The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app's capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.

**7\. Video bitrate limit on Twitter**

Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps

## Part 2\. How to post videos on Twitter?

Both Twitter In-feed videos and Twitter video advertising have comparable video specs, which is fortunate for you.

To give you a heads up, high-resolution picture uploads use more data. As a result, if your data plan is restricted, it might soon be depleted. You should not be concerned about having an unlimited data plan.

## Conclusion

Given Twitter's size, it's hardly unexpected that certain restrictions are in place. This isn't to say that you won't be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these **best formats for Twitter videos** in mind. They're important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you. There are plenty of firms that can make videos that get your brand recognized, in the right file format, and optimized to meet all of Twitter's video requirements.
