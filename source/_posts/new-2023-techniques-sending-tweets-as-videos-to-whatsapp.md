With the increasing popularity of the already popular messaging app 'WhatsApp,' users tend to share everything using WhatsApp, be it links, documents, music, or videos of any sort.

In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.
