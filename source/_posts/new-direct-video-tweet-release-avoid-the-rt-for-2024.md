Retweeting is a great way to share videos and posts quickly with just a single click. However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.

Retweets also don't allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:

## Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos

If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:

### Build a Relationship with the Audience

Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.

### Your own Input to a Situation

While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.

### A better Look for your Twitter Profile

Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.

Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn't look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.

### Market your Own Brand

When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people's tweets won't cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.

### You are not Credited for the Content

If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn't exist at all.

Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else's data, not creating your own.

* Under the Compose Tweet box, you will find the option to add a video from your gallery.
* For ease of access, the most recent videos in the gallery will appear as top thumbnails, and you will find the video you just downloaded in it.
* You can then trim the length of the video as the max limit for a video is 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
* Once trimmed, you can click on Tweet to post the video along with a lovely caption.

And that is how you can post a Twitter video without retweeting it from your iPhone.

## Conclusion

While retweeting takes a single click, posting the same video on your Twitter profile without Retweeting also takes around the same amount of time. Creating your own post rather than retweeting makes you prominent on a platform with millions of people. Whether you are an android user or an iPhone user, the above methods will work all the same.

Give your followers some new content rather than just retweeting posts with this new method. Follow the steps mentioned above, and you will easily be able to share a video on Twitter without retweeting.

And you will see the positive impact it has on your profile marketing your content.

Retweeting is a great way to share videos and posts quickly with just a single click. However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.

Retweets also don't allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:

## Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos

If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:

### Build a Relationship with the Audience

Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.

### Your own Input to a Situation

While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.

### A better Look for your Twitter Profile

Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.

Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn't look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.

### Market your Own Brand

When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people's tweets won't cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.

### You are not Credited for the Content

If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn't exist at all.

Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else's data, not creating your own.

### 2\. Sharing Twitter Videos with the Shortcuts App

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-8.png)

* Next, open your phone’s browser and open <https://www.tvdl.app/>. With TVDL, you can download Twitter videos on your phone by entering their URL.
* You will see the **Get Shortcut**option on your screen. Tap on it.
* This will redirect to the shortcuts app, where you can create a shortcut for the website.
* Add the TVDL link there and in the description, tap on **Add Untrusted Shortcut**.

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-9.png)

* Tap on the small share icon under the Tweet and then tap on **Share Video Via….**

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-10.png)

* You can then select the download quality, and the video will start downloading.
* Once downloaded, it will save in your Photos app.

![twitter videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-11.png)

* To Tweet, the video, open your Twitter account and go to Create a New Tweet.
* Under the Compose Tweet box, you will find the option to add a video from your gallery.
* For ease of access, the most recent videos in the gallery will appear as top thumbnails, and you will find the video you just downloaded in it.
* You can then trim the length of the video as the max limit for a video is 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
* Once trimmed, you can click on Tweet to post the video along with a lovely caption.
