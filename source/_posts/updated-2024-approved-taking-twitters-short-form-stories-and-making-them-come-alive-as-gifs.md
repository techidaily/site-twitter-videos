**Step 5:**

You can download GIFs directly after clicking the download option.

### 2\. HNET

Another amazing tool we have to convert Twitter videos into GIFs is HNET. Besides being an online Twitter video to GIF converter, it can convert images, pdfs, audios, ICO and houses a number of tools.HNET can convert any video into GIFs in a matter of seconds.

Go to HNET and click the Image Converter box to select the video to GIF converter, from the drop-down.

**Step.4**

Now, click on "download", and your GIF will be saved.
