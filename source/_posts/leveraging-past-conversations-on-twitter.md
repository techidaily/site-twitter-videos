## Part 3: Open your Twitter Archive

Once you have requested a Twitter archive, you will receive a mail saying that you can download your Twitter archive. At this point, you have two options to access your Twitter archive. Firstly, you can download the archive either from the link in the email or consider going through your Twitter account. To download the archive from Twitter directly, the steps are:

**Step 1:** Open your account and tap on "More." Select "Settings and Privacy" by clicking on it. Go to “Your Account” and select "Download an archive of your data." Provide a password and two-factor verification code if you have enabled it.

![initiate archive download process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/use-twitter-archive-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, you will see the option of "Download Archive." Click on this option and then tap to download the ZIP file on your computer.
