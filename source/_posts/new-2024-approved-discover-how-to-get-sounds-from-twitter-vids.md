So, let's begin!

### 1\. Problem with the App

There could be a problem with Twitter video sound because of an in-app issue. For example, you have an outdated version of the app, or the app cache is full. Things like that can often create issues and hinder the app's functionality.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Network Connectivity

A weak network connection can also be a common cause of no sound or poor video quality. With a weak or faulty connection, you will see a loading symbol on the video/audio file that never seems to end – something painstakingly annoying!

A strong internet connection will avoid Twitter videos' improper functionality and smoothly load the file's contents.

### 3\. Old Browsers

An old browser lags and does not load files properly. Thus, it can be a reason for no audio on the Twitter videos. Either update the browser or switch to a new browser altogether.

### 4\. The Twitter Cache

The browser cookies or cache and Twitter application cache can also cause Twitter video sound problems. When the cache is full, the app or browser will not perform to its optimal potential.

### 3\. Disable Chrome Plugins/Extensions

Follow these steps:

* Type **chrome://settings**in the address bar of Chrome browser and press Enter.

### 1\. Problem with the App

There could be a problem with Twitter video sound because of an in-app issue. For example, you have an outdated version of the app, or the app cache is full. Things like that can often create issues and hinder the app's functionality.

### 2\. Network Connectivity

A weak network connection can also be a common cause of no sound or poor video quality. With a weak or faulty connection, you will see a loading symbol on the video/audio file that never seems to end – something painstakingly annoying!

A strong internet connection will avoid Twitter videos' improper functionality and smoothly load the file's contents.

## How to Fix No Sound on Twitter Videos on Chrome?

Sometimes no sound on Twitter videos could be due to a browser-related issue. Let’s talk about all the possible methods to fix no sound on Twitter videos on Chrome:

### 1\. Enable Flash

If Chrome flash is disabled, then your videos will not play on Chrome. Click on the lock shape icon on the address bar, and make sure flash is not blocked.

If flash is disabled and outdated, install the updated version.

### 2\. Clear Cookies and Cache

Sounds too simple right? But you’d be surprised to know that 99% of browser-related problems are fixed once you clear cookies and cache.

To clear cookies and cache:

* Go to Chrome Settings by clicking on the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the browser.
* Search for Cookie and select ‘clear browsing data’ under Security and privacy.
* Select ‘Cookies and other site data’ and ‘cached images and files' and click on Clear Data.

![Clear cache for smooth browser experience](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-2.jpg)

Hopefully, this will resolve the issue of no Twitter video sound on the Chrome browser.

### 3\. Disable Chrome Plugins/Extensions

If none of the steps above have worked so far and your Twitter videos are playing in other browsers except for Chrome, try managing your extensions.

For this, you have to disable Chrome extensions and reload to check if the Twitter video plays audio.

Here is how you can do this:

* Click on the three dots on the top right corner of the address bar and select More Tools > “Extensions.”
* Your Chrome extensions will be listed so you can easily manage them one by one.

You can also do this:

* Type **chrome://extensions** in the search bar and hit Enter.
* Turn off all the plugins, particularly the advertisement blockers.
* Now close the browser and launch again.

![Disable plug-ins and extensions](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/why-> is-there-no-sound-on-twitter- videos-3.jpg)

This should resolve the issue and play sound on Twitter videos in Chrome.

### 4\. Disable Hardware Acceleration

If managing your extensions did not do the job for you, disabling hardware acceleration in Chrome might help resolve the issue.

Follow these steps:

* Type **chrome://settings**in the address bar of Chrome browser and press Enter.
* Scroll down to System and turn off Use hardware acceleration when available.
* Close the window and launch Chrome again. Now load the Twitter video again and play.

### 5\. Update Your Browser

Sometimes simply updating the browser can resolve the problem, especially if there has been a while since you last updated the browser.

* To check if you use Chrome’s latest version, click on the three dots on the right and click on Settings.
* Type updates in the search bar and hit Enter.
* Chrome will run a check and updates that need to be installed.
