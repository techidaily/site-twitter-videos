In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.

## Send a Twitter Video to WhatsApp with Link

Most people who use Twitter do not tend to open their Direct Messages often because there are not many features in the Twitter application related to messages. Well, it is more of a public app meant for sharing Tweets and not messages.

## Step 4: Select the Contact

Tapping on WhatsApp will close Twitter and take you to WhatsApp with a list of all your contacts. Select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with, and press send from that list.

## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Well, you learned all the steps revolving around how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not have Twitter? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else. Still, you cannot embed it with the link.

There is an easy way to counter this problem if you wish to share Twitter Videos on WhatsApp directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on WhatsApp without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.

## Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share

Scroll through your Twitter feed and locate the video you want to share with your friends. Once you have finalized the video that you wish to share, tap the share icon right below the video.

## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality options to choose from. Various quality options are available, including 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality. The size of the download file varies with the quality. The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.

![Different file sizes and quantities ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-13.jpg)

Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it.

## Step 4: Share it on WhatsApp

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up WhatsApp, navigate to the chat of the person or group you wish to send the video to, and attach the video from the in-app file manager, or you can share it directly from your gallery.
