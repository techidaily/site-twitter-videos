Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it.

## Step 4: Share it on WhatsApp

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up WhatsApp, navigate to the chat of the person or group you wish to send the video to, and attach the video from the in-app file manager, or you can share it directly from your gallery.
