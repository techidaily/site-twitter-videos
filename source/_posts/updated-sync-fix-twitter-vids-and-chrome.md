This will definitely solve the problem of videos not playing by returning the website to its original form and restoring all the settings that you might have made.

1. #### Disable Chrome Extensions

If you are still facing Twitter videos not playing in Chrome but playing in other browsers after applying all the above methods. You should try disabling all the Chrome extensions that are enabled in your Chrome browser, then reload the page and check if the videos are playing now or not.

To disable Chrome extensions, go to the "More Tools" then click on "Extensions".

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix7.jpg)

After disabling all the extensions, reload the page and see if the videos are playing or not.

In this window of settings, scroll down to advance settings. Under the "System", you disable the "Use Hardware Acceleration When Available". Relaunch the browser after disabling this.

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix9.jpg)

Now try to play the Twitter videos. Hopefully, it will work now. If not then you can try the last step.

1. #### Update your Browser

Are you still facing the same problem with Twitter videos after all the changes? Then the last thing you should try is to update your browser. If you are running an outdated version of Chrome, it might hinder the videos from playing. In addition, the outdated version can make your browser incompatible with Twitter videos. You can quickly check if your browser is an updated version of Chrome or not by clicking on the three dots on the top right corner of the browser. If it shows you an option to update your browser, you are running an outdated Chrome version. Therefore, you should update it as soon as possible to fix all the problems related to it, including playing Twitter videos.

All the above methods are tested and proven to fix Twitter videos not playing in Chrome by many users. All these methods can be applied easily to your browser and don't need technical skills or expertise. Check all the ways to see which method works best for you.
