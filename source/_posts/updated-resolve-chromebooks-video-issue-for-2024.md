This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos. If this was the reason behind the Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, allowing flash will solve this problem.

1. #### Clear Cookies and Cache

Clearing cookies and cache can solve multiple problems related to web browsers. If the above method didn't work for you, try clearing your Chrome browser's cookies and cache. This method will restore any changes or settings that were saved and make your browser load the website in its original form. To do that, go to the setting of Chrome.

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix4.jpg)

Under the setting panel find and choose 'Clear Browsing Data'.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![twitter-video-not-playing-fix5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix5.jpg)

Now select the time range, you should select the 'All time' for the required result and click "Clear Data".

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix6.jpg)

This will definitely solve the problem of videos not playing by returning the website to its original form and restoring all the settings that you might have made.

1. #### Disable Chrome Extensions

If you are still facing Twitter videos not playing in Chrome but playing in other browsers after applying all the above methods. You should try disabling all the Chrome extensions that are enabled in your Chrome browser, then reload the page and check if the videos are playing now or not.

To disable Chrome extensions, go to the "More Tools" then click on "Extensions".

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix7.jpg)

It will open a new window that contains all the extensions that are installed in your Chrome browser. Disable each of these extensions one by one.

After disabling all the extensions, reload the page and see if the videos are playing or not.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![twitter-video-not-playing-fix8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix8.jpg)

1. #### Disable Hardware Acceleration

Is it still not working? Try disabling Hardware Acceleration in your Chrome browser, this might help you play Twitter videos. To Disable Hardware Acceleration, go to the settings of Chrome. In this window of settings, scroll down to advance settings. Under the "System", you disable the "Use Hardware Acceleration When Available". Relaunch the browser after disabling this.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![twitter-video-not-playing-fix9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix9.jpg)

Now try to play the Twitter videos. Hopefully, it will work now. If not then you can try the last step.

1. #### Update your Browser

Are you still facing the same problem with Twitter videos after all the changes? Then the last thing you should try is to update your browser. If you are running an outdated version of Chrome, it might hinder the videos from playing. In addition, the outdated version can make your browser incompatible with Twitter videos. You can quickly check if your browser is an updated version of Chrome or not by clicking on the three dots on the top right corner of the browser. If it shows you an option to update your browser, you are running an outdated Chrome version. Therefore, you should update it as soon as possible to fix all the problems related to it, including playing Twitter videos.

All the above methods are tested and proven to fix Twitter videos not playing in Chrome by many users. All these methods can be applied easily to your browser and don't need technical skills or expertise. Check all the ways to see which method works best for you.
