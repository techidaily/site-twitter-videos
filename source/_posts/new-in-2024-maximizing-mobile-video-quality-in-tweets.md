## How To Fix Twitter HD Videos Not Playing on Chrome?

In this condition, you need to copy the link and download it to watch it.

### Browser’s Flash

When you notice that a Twitter HD video is being played on your mobile but not on your Chrome, you need to check Chrome Settings. The reason behind this happening might be that the browser’s flash is not enabled.
