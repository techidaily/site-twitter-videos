## Part 1: How to Save a GIF from Twitter on iPhone

As you all know that most of the uploaded GIFs get converted into MP4 format automatically and then display at the respective platform on the Twitter environment. In a similar tone, if you want to download a GIF from Twitter on your phone, then you need a special tool or app to customize it according to the device settings.

**Step 2:** Log in to your Twitter account and reach out for the desired GIF image you want.

**Step 3:** Choose ‘Share Tweet Via’ by tapping the down arrow at the top right side of the screen.
