In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up WhatsApp, navigate to the chat of the person or group you wish to send the video to, and attach the video from the in-app file manager, or you can share it directly from your gallery.
