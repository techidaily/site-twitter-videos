A viral video on Twitter is a post quickly shared by a significant number of people. Though there are no hard and fast standards for what constitutes a viral tweet, it is deemed viral if it receives thousands and millions of retweets, Twitter favorites, and responses.

## How to Go Viral on Twitter

With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it's quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it's simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:

### 1\. Use Hashtags

Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets' range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.

You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.

### 2\. Inject Humor

Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don't have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.

### 3\. Keep the Caption Short

Even if Twitter's total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.

### 4\. Share A Personal Story

You can't go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I've always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: \[link\].

## Conclusion

There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral **Twitter video hot** is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.

## How to Go Viral on Twitter

With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it's quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it's simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:

### 1\. Use Hashtags

Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets' range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.

You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.

### 2\. Inject Humor

Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don't have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.

### 3\. Keep the Caption Short

Even if Twitter's total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.

### 4\. Share A Personal Story

You can't go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I've always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: \[link\].

## Conclusion

There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral **Twitter video hot** is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.

### 7\. [**Kit Harrington Won't Eat His Cereals**](https://twitter.com/%5FEugeneTV/status/1132367464459841536)

This viral Twitter video is titled "In loving remembrance of the "Ryan Gosling won't eat his cereal" vines." This video was posted on May 26, 2019, from an account named Eugene Buenaventura, and it has around 1.4M Twitter views to date. In this video, Kit Harrington, known for playing John Snow in the popular TV series Game of Thrones, is offered something to eat that he is not eating.

Following a succession of six-second footage of A-list actor Ryan Gosling being fed a spoonful of breakfast cereal, this clip took its artistic expression as a famous culture treasure on Vine. The video's caption assured that it swiftly became viral, mirroring the internet trajectory of a significant breakthrough news item.

The popularity of the Gosling viral demonstrates the importance of strategically seeding your material with the key influencers and how, in some situations, a small number of people may go worldwide.

### 8\. [**Dove Brand Campaign**](https://twitter.com/Ogilvy/status/1193196170446802944)

The tagline for this video reads, "Dove's inaugural purpose-driven marketing puts an end to armpit worry. More on the stereotype-busting spot can be seen on @CampaignLiveUS ". It was posted on November 09, 2019, and has around 4K views to the date.

The film for Dove's Real Beauty Sketches #WeAreBeautiful ad traveled unlike any other, thanks to a long tail of connection and strong audience reaction.

This video has shown less fatigue than the others and fewer influencer-induced spikes. Instead, the dialogue took place in clusters of towns scattered over the world, demonstrating the importance of local interaction and highlighting the practical usage of a digital outreach campaign.

### 9\. [**Cats Defying Laws of Physics**](https://twitter.com/ladbible/status/1485553202607108096)

This hot video on Twitter has the caption, "Cats defying all laws of physics." On January 24, 2022, it was posted by a famous Twitter account named [@LADBible](https://twitter.com/ladbible/status/1485553202607108096). LADBible has been famous for posting trendy twitter videos to entertain its followers for a long time. Moreover, this Twitter account has many followers (around 2.9M), including some celebrities.

Although the caption of the video seems a bit cheesy to you at first, you would be amazed and wonder how those cats are doing that stuff when you see the video. In the video, cats are going under the locked door, running on vertical walls, walking under the bed upside down, jumping up to the room's roof, coming out of a thing cage, etc., which is not exactly typical for a cat do. Furthermore, this video has 270K views.

### 10\. [**Man Eating His Phone**](https://twitter.com/ladbible/status/1485356665096392706)

This hot viral clip on Twitter has the title, "Are you eating that?". It is yet another video posted from the LADBible, a famous page on Twitter that pots trendy and viral videos to entertain its followers and let them have a good time on Twitter. This video was posted on January 24, 2021, with around 688K views.

After reading the caption, you won't get the idea of what it is about, so we recommend watching it. However, if you're too lazy for that, keep reading. It is a 24-second clip featuring a sleeping guy who has a pizza slice in one hand and his phone in the other. After he wakes up, he starts eating his phone instead of the pizza, which looks funny and a bit embarrassing for the man, who just got captured while doing that.

## How to Go Viral on Twitter

With the massive popularity of sites like Instagram and TikTok, it's quick to overlook Twitter advertising as a waste of effort. However, Twitter is very far from lifeless. With many profiles still gaining attention, it's simple to see how it may increase traffic and raise visibility for your company. To make viral videos on Twitter, follow these strategies:

### 1\. Use Hashtags

Hashtags can also help you increase your tweets' range (and viral impact). The concept behind hashtags is to cluster tweets collectively around a specific topic to simplify their search.

You may include them in your updates to increase the number of people who see and interact with your material. On Twitter, check the trending area to locate hot hashtags. You may also change the view based on your location.

### 2\. Inject Humor

Using humor in your posts might also help you launch a popular Twitter thread. In reality, many of the most popular tweets have a sense of humor, and they don't have to be very sophisticated. This technique can help you grow a good following and make your video viral on Twitter.

### 3\. Keep the Caption Short

Even if Twitter's total character limit has been extended to 280, it is still challenging to keep your messages brief. To be honest, the smaller your captions are, the finer. Captions with 110 characters or less are the most effective. This is because they leave an area for mentions, hashtags, and hyperlinks.

### 4\. Share A Personal Story

You can't go wrong with conveying a personal tale if you want to compose a viral tweet. Having your tweets more personalized rather than only informative will yield more significant results. For example, I've always struggled to develop the correct tweet until I came upon this hack: \[link\].

## Conclusion

There was no simple internet engagement between fans and their favorite celebrities or lawmakers and the local population before Twitter. Twitter has unquestionably narrowed the gap between the peoples of the two worlds and has repeatedly been shown to be the most delicate communication channel. Learning what the viral **Twitter video hot** is intriguing for someone who is constantly interested in what is on-trend these days.
