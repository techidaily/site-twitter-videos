Hashtags are very common on Twitter, and you will rarely find videos that do not have hashtags. This feature is very helpful because it helps you classify your videos, making them quick to access.

### 4\. Flash that Logo

Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.

### 5\. Include Captions

93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it's important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.

Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.

### 7\. Engage More Than You Broadcast

Brands have forgotten that Twitter is a social network but not a marketing tool in some cases. As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.

However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.

### 4\. Flash that Logo

Twitter recommends that brands place their logos within their video frame and just immediately at the start of the video to drive brand association from the beginning. When logos are placed evidently, the brand recall will increase by 30%.

You can also put your logo in the upper right or left-hand corner of your video to increase the chances of the brand recall but make sure it is in a more catchy position.

### 5\. Include Captions

93% of videos on Twitter are viewed through mobile phones; therefore, it's important to have a video accompanied by sound. This is because many people use Twitter and other social media when they are on the go, and in some cases, they might not access sound.

Therefore, it is important to use captions and other forms of text to give your video more context so that the viewers can better understand the context.

### 7\. Engage More Than You Broadcast

Brands have forgotten that Twitter is a social network but not a marketing tool in some cases. As a result, Twitter feeds are full of brands and marketers strictly uploading links to their websites for marketing purposes.

However, some top brands do not allow broadcasting messages on their sites. But if you aim to develop your audience or use Twitter for roles other than brand messaging, you have to engage.

### Conclusion

There are approximately 330 million active users on Twitter each month; with such a big number, your organic post might easily get lost in the crowd. So, selling video ads as an investment should consider getting your brand to the next level. On the other hand, ensure that you follow all the required video specifications for each Twitter video. This is because the last thing you want is an attractive video that cannot be posted. After all, it has the wrong aspect ratio for Twitter video or wrong Twitter video file size. In this case, you need Filmora to resize your videos easily.
