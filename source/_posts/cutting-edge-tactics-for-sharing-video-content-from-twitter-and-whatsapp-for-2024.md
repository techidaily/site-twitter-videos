With the increasing popularity of the already popular messaging app 'WhatsApp,' users tend to share everything using WhatsApp, be it links, documents, music, or videos of any sort. It has now come to this point that even videos and links from other social media platforms are also being shared using WhatsApp.

In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.

## Send a Twitter Video to WhatsApp with Link

Most people who use Twitter do not tend to open their Direct Messages often because there are not many features in the Twitter application related to messages. Well, it is more of a public app meant for sharing Tweets and not messages.

Suppose you need to share something with your friends or anyone else. In that case, the wisest way to do so is to send them a link on a messaging platform almost everyone uses. Yes, you guessed it right, that messaging application is WhatsApp.

Below are the steps you can follow if you want to send a Twitter video via WhatsApp using the link.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter account using your credentials if you are not already logged in.

## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Well, you learned all the steps revolving around how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not have Twitter? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else. Still, you cannot embed it with the link.

There is an easy way to counter this problem if you wish to share Twitter Videos on WhatsApp directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on WhatsApp without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Various quality options are available, including 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality. The size of the download file varies with the quality. The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter.
