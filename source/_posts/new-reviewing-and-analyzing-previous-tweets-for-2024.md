**Step 4:** The “Personalization” tab contains all the information and interests Twitter has about you. By clicking on this tab, you can find other tabs like:

* Advertiser lists will show the Twitter advertisers who have added you as the audience.
* The Interests tab will contain all the activities that Twitter predicts you like. This is highly based on the kind of searches that are performed across the account.
* Saved searches will show any searches you have stored in your Twitter account.

**Step 5:** The “Ads” tab will display all the advertisements Twitter has shown to you. By clicking on an ad, you can find its target audience and will also contain the reason why it was displayed to you. Another tab is "Lists," and by clicking on it, you will find the Twitter lists you have ever subscribed to or created.
