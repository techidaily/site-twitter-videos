Fake and inactive accounts can limit your ability to connect with Twitter users that actually want to comment, share or like the content you post on this social media network. The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don't post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.
