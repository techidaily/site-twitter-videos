## Conclusion

Twitter is no question one of the most popular social media platforms today and it’s becoming better day by day with its user base exchanging plenty of media material in nearly every genre, music, politics, fashion, gossip, news, and technology, to name a few. Compared to Instagram and Facebook, you will discover more GIFs on Twitter. Also, Twitter offers a specialized GIF search engine that all Twitter users may access. However, the issue is, the platform doesn’t enable you to download the GIFs uploaded on the site. Hence you can use the **Twitter gif saver** we’ve mentioned above to get on track.
