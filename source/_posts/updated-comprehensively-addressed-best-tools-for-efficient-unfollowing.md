 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Fake and inactive accounts can limit your ability to connect with Twitter users that actually want to comment, share or like the content you post on this social media network. The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don't post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.

If you are having a tough time deciding which **unfollow apps** you should use, you are at the right place because in this article we are going to present top seven options that are currently available at the market.

Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.

## 7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter

Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.

#### 1\. SocialOopmph

SocialOomph is much more than just a simple unfollow tool because it enables its users to schedule tweets, track hashtags or manage multiple Twitter accounts. The free version of the tool is available, but it offers a limited amount of options. In order to unlock all of the app's features, you must purchase its professional version that costs $17, 97.

#### 2\. CrowdFire

You can discover accounts on Twitter that don't follow you back, optimize your Twitter account or preschedule tweets with this remarkably powerful and diverse social media tool. CrowdFire enables you to manage all of your accounts on social media from one place, and it lets you optimize each post for the platform you want to share it on. Discovering trending topics, hashtags and profiles that attract a lot of attention in your niche is easy with CrowdFire, and you can either use it from your computer, iPhone or Android phone.

#### 3\. Who Unfollowed Me

Besides showing you who unfollowed you on Twitter, this online tool lets you know if your account has been blocked by someone and it shows you this list of accounts that don't follow you back. In addition, the Who Unfollowed Me platform shows you the people you unfollowed and new followers over a period of time, which makes it an amazing tool for Twitter account optimization. Free and paid versions are available.

#### 4\. Manage Flitter

Finding which Twitter accounts you should unfollow is just one out of many powerful tools the Manage Flitter offers. You can access the analytics features, schedule tweets for different time zones or manage two or more Twitter accounts with this tool. The free version lets you clean up your account on Twitter, but if you would like to use the advanced tools Manage Flitter provides, you will have to purchase the Pro version that costs $12 per month or the Business version that costs $49 per month.

#### 5\. Unfollower Stats

The Unfollower Stats tool is remarkably easy to use and it enables you to track fake accounts or people who don't follow you back. You just have to log in to your Twitter account and let the Unfollower Stats collect the information about the accounts you should unfollow. In addition, this tool enables you to track daily changes on the unfollower list. The Unfollower Stats is free to use, although you first have to sign in before you can start cleaning up your Twitter account.

#### 6\. Tweepi
