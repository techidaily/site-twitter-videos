## Part 2: How to Request Twitter Archive?

Once you are aware of why the Twitter archive is considered to be used across an account, it is now time to understand the process of obtaining one. This part will guide you with the ultimate steps to request a Twitter archive manually. Just follow our below guidelines:

**Step 1:** Firstly, sign in to your Twitter account by entering your name and password. Once open, click on “More” from the left side menu. Now tap on "Settings and Privacy," which will open another menu. From there, click on "Your Account."

## Part 3: Open your Twitter Archive

Once you have requested a Twitter archive, you will receive a mail saying that you can download your Twitter archive. At this point, you have two options to access your Twitter archive.

**Step 1:** Open your account and tap on "More." Select "Settings and Privacy" by clicking on it. Go to “Your Account” and select "Download an archive of your data." Provide a password and two-factor verification code if you have enabled it.
