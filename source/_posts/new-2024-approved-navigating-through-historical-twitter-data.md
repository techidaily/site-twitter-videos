### Save your Memories

Even if you have lost the DMs, photos, and videos on your Twitter account, you can still save your memories through Twitter Archive. The archive file will contain all the memories you have created on Twitter. It would surely act as your digital scrapbook that would comprise of all important events and instances in your life that you would like to cherish in your older ages.

### Save your Tweets

Some regular Twitter users use third-party tools to download tweets and posts from Twitter. However, it may involve some risk factors in the third-party software. That’s why downloading the tweets directly from the Twitter archive is safe and reliable.
