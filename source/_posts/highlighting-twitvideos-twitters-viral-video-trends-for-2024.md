### 3\. Brunna's best moments in Big Brother Brazil

This video is posted on Big Brother Brazil’s Twitter account. Brunna Goncalves is a famed dancer in Brazil and recently participated in the popular reality show Big Brother’s Brazil edition. The video is drawing attention after she has been pointed out as a 'plant' by the public. The video is titled “Best moments of Brunna." However, she’s doing nothing special in the video. The video shows moments of her doing nothing or being silent.

### 4\. A meme-based reaction on Tom Brady's retirement

This video is posted on Pardon My Take’s official Twitter account. Pardon My Take or PMT is a comedic sports podcast by Barstool Sports.

### 5\. The final touchdown pass of Tom Brady

It’s the video of the final moments of the NFL’s match showing the final touchdown pass of Tom Brady. It’s a thrilling video of the moment from the match and Tom Brady can be seen celebrating the moment as he completed the final touchdown pass after making an athletic attempt to catch the ball.

### 6\. An essay on Tom Brady's career

### 7\. Subway work collapse

The video is a recording of the horrific moment when a section of the asphalt collapsed right next to where the subway work is going on. It happened early in the morning so there was no traffic on the road and no harm occurred. However, the express lane was later opened for traffic after the completion of repair work. Instances like these are rarely captured as they’re happening, so it’s no surprise why this video is trending on Twitter.
