Twitter is a social media platform with a lot of content volume shared each day. People and pages compete for more likes, followers, comments, etc. The competition is basically to engage a more significant audience, and people tend to use different tactics.

In this article, you will be taught how to add a thumbnail to a Twitter video, change it and even enhance its looks.

It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object.

It should not look alien in any way.
