### Make a Virtual Diary

Twitter archive will contain all the moments you have curated through Twitter. Also, you will have a backup of all your Twitter activities and data. So you can make a virtual diary from these memories and information and share it on online platforms.

### Recover your Data

If you have deleted any important post or picture on your Twitter, you don’t need to worry. All the data that you have shared across Twitter is recoverable. Through the Twitter archive, you can easily retrieve the lost post and save it permanently on your computer.

## Part 2: How to Request Twitter Archive?

Once you are aware of why the Twitter archive is considered to be used across an account, it is now time to understand the process of obtaining one. This part will guide you with the ultimate steps to request a Twitter archive manually. Just follow our below guidelines:

**Step 1:** Firstly, sign in to your Twitter account by entering your name and password. Once open, click on “More” from the left side menu. Now tap on "Settings and Privacy," which will open another menu. From there, click on "Your Account."
