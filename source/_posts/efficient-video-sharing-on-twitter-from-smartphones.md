Retweeting is a great way to share videos and posts quickly with just a single click. However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.

Retweets also don't allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:

## Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos

If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:

### Build a Relationship with the Audience

Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.

### Your own Input to a Situation

While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### A better Look for your Twitter Profile

Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.

Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn't look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Market your Own Brand

When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people's tweets won't cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### You are not Credited for the Content

If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn't exist at all.

Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else's data, not creating your own.

Retweeting is a great way to share videos and posts quickly with just a single click. However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.

Retweets also don't allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:

## Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos

If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:

### Build a Relationship with the Audience

Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.

### Your own Input to a Situation

While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### A better Look for your Twitter Profile

Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.

Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn't look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Market your Own Brand

When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people's tweets won't cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.

### You are not Credited for the Content

If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn't exist at all.

Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else's data, not creating your own.
