<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Tip no 2: Be Minimal

Overdoing anything kills its purpose and appeal. It should be catchy but do not cram too much information into the thumbnail. Do not include an overly crowded photo or out-of-context things; it will take away the essence of your context. You can add simple graphics or photos and text that best describes your video's primary purpose or topic.

### Tip no 3: Visible text

Make sure the text that you add to your thumbnail is appropriately visible. Its contrast is set such that the text does not blend in with the background but stands out from it. Hence, it is easily readable and does not create a light effect resulting in the audience skipping your video.

### Tip no 4: Size

The dimensions of your thumbnail photo should be as such that they are compatible with all screen sizes as different users will watch the video on different devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc., so you should not crop out the thumbnail in any way.

### Tip no 5: Use a face

It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object. You can always use a face to catch your audience's attention, but make sure the face is related to the video and does not misguide anyone regarding the topic and context of your video.

### Tip no 6: Editing and Color Scheme

Always edit and treat the thumbnail photo beforehand. It should be catchy and compliment the content of the video. Be careful while choosing the color scheme of your photo; you can use a similar color palette as your video, or you can use colors in contrast to the theme of your video. It should not look alien in any way.

### Tip no 2: Be Minimal

Overdoing anything kills its purpose and appeal. It should be catchy but do not cram too much information into the thumbnail. Do not include an overly crowded photo or out-of-context things; it will take away the essence of your context. You can add simple graphics or photos and text that best describes your video's primary purpose or topic.

### Tip no 3: Visible text

Make sure the text that you add to your thumbnail is appropriately visible. Its contrast is set such that the text does not blend in with the background but stands out from it. Hence, it is easily readable and does not create a light effect resulting in the audience skipping your video.

### Tip no 4: Size

The dimensions of your thumbnail photo should be as such that they are compatible with all screen sizes as different users will watch the video on different devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc., so you should not crop out the thumbnail in any way.

### Tip no 5: Use a face

It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object. You can always use a face to catch your audience's attention, but make sure the face is related to the video and does not misguide anyone regarding the topic and context of your video.
