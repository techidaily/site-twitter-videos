Conversion software is more tedious than using an online converter. You don't need to download any software; upload the Twitter video, and they'll convert it to a GIF in no time. They do, however, have some restrictions, such as file size limits and upload time limits.

If these restrictions aren't a deal-breaker for you, try one of the online Twitter GIF producers below.

**Step.1**

Now click on ‘Convert’.

**Step 4:**

Your video will start converting. You can see the status in the progress bar.

**Step 5:**

You can download GIFs directly after clicking the download option.

### 2\. HNET

Another amazing tool we have to convert Twitter videos into GIFs is HNET. Besides being an online Twitter video to GIF converter, it can convert images, pdfs, audios, ICO and houses a number of tools.HNET can convert any video into GIFs in a matter of seconds. You can change the width, length, height, and frames per second of the GIF. After one hour, all uploaded files will be deleted, making them safe and secure.

Here's how to do it:

**Step.1**

Go to HNET and click the Image Converter box to select the video to GIF converter, from the drop-down.

**Step.2**

Click on ‘Upload A Video’ and select the video you want to convert. The maximum size of the video you upload can be up to 300 MB.

**Step.4**

Now, click on "download", and your GIF will be saved.
