You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.

## Record and Send

You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.

## Step 4: Select the Contact

Tapping on Snapchat will close Twitter and take you to the Snapchat application with a list of all your contacts. From that list, select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with and press send.

Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.

## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else, but the link embedding does not work.

There is an easy way to overcome this issue if you wish to share Twitter Videos on Snapchat directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on Snapchat without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.

## Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share

Scroll through your Twitter and locate the video you want to share with your friends on Snapchat. Once you have finalized the video that you wish to share, tap the share icon right below the video.

## Step 3: Copy Link

Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few sharing options for the video. Select the 'Copy Link' option, and the video link will be copied to your device's clipboard.

## Step 4: Open pastedownload.com

Head to your internet browser and type in 'pastedownload.com.' It is an online video downloading tool that helps you save videos offline using their link only, and then you can easily share the videos.

## Step 2: Paste the Link

Copy and paste the link to the Twitter video in the dialogue box of the website.

![Paste the link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-7.jpg)

Once the link is pasted, it will automatically start the conversion process and convert the video in a matter of seconds, and the video will be ready to download.

## Step 3: Download the Video in the Desired Format

As soon as the conversion is completed, the website will show you the video preview and different options of sizes and video quality to choose from. There are various quality options available that include 568p, 852p, 1278p, and HD quality, and the size of the download file varies with the quality.

The size options of the video available for download will also vary depending on the actual file uploaded on Twitter. Choose the file size and quality that matches your requirements and click download. The file will download into your device's internal storage, and now you can easily share it on Snapchat.

## Step 4: Share it on Snapchat

Now that the file is downloaded, all you have to do is open up Snapchat, swipe up from the main screen to the camera roll, press and hold on to the video you have downloaded, and select send snap. It will then take you to the contacts list to send the video to any individual group or upload it to your story.

## Conclusion

It can be a hassle if your friends do not use the same social media platforms as you do or if sharing videos on the same social media platforms is an issue. You cannot just take a screenshot and send it to anyone as it is a video, and video sharing does not work like that. But we have got you.

Now that you know all methods of sharing Twitter Videos on Snapchat, with or without the link, follow the steps mentioned above, and it will save you and your friends from the nuisance caused by inter-platform video sharing.
