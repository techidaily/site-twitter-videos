It works on all devices. All the videos that are downloaded are pulled from Twitter’s CDN servers making them fully secure to use. If chrome is not being utilized the download would not start on its own. You would have to right-click on the button “download” and then pick “save as” and store the movie anywhere you like.

##### Pros

Support removing and previewing.

Allow you to pick resolution and quality.

Lightweight and clever application.

##### Cons

It can fail to distinguish whether your link is an image or video.

Ads appear with every click you make.

## Conclusion

Twitter is no question one of the most popular social media platforms today and it’s becoming better day by day with its user base exchanging plenty of media material in nearly every genre, music, politics, fashion, gossip, news, and technology, to name a few. Compared to Instagram and Facebook, you will discover more GIFs on Twitter. Also, Twitter offers a specialized GIF search engine that all Twitter users may access. However, the issue is, the platform doesn’t enable you to download the GIFs uploaded on the site. Hence you can use the **Twitter gif saver** we’ve mentioned above to get on track.
