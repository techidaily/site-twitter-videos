### 7\. [Subway work collapse](https://twitter.com/fala%5Fbrasil/status/1488493502153515009?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1488493502153515009%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fvideos.trends24.in%2F)

The video is a recording of the horrific moment when a section of the asphalt collapsed right next to where the subway work is going on. It happened early in the morning so there was no traffic on the road and no harm occurred. However, the express lane was later opened for traffic after the completion of repair work. Instances like these are rarely captured as they’re happening, so it’s no surprise why this video is trending on Twitter.

A video trending on Twitter shared by Josiah Johnson is a meme-based take on the recent allegations made by American football coach Brian Flores. He said that there’s a factor of racism involved in the hiring process of NFL coaches. He has filed a lawsuit against the NFL, claiming bias in the coaching search. The video is only 1 second long.
