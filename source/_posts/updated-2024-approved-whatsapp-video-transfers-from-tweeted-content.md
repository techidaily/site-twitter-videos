In this article, you will learn how to share Twitter videos via WhatsApp the way you wish, i.e., with or without the link.

## Send a Twitter Video to WhatsApp with Link

Most people who use Twitter do not tend to open their Direct Messages often because there are not many features in the Twitter application related to messages. Well, it is more of a public app meant for sharing Tweets and not messages.
