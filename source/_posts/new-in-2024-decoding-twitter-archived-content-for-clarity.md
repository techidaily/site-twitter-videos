* Advertiser lists will show the Twitter advertisers who have added you as the audience.
* The Interests tab will contain all the activities that Twitter predicts you like. This is highly based on the kind of searches that are performed across the account.
* Saved searches will show any searches you have stored in your Twitter account.
