## Part 3: Open your Twitter Archive

Once you have requested a Twitter archive, you will receive a mail saying that you can download your Twitter archive. At this point, you have two options to access your Twitter archive. Firstly, you can download the archive either from the link in the email or consider going through your Twitter account. To download the archive from Twitter directly, the steps are:

**Step 1:** Open your account and tap on "More." Select "Settings and Privacy" by clicking on it. Go to “Your Account” and select "Download an archive of your data." Provide a password and two-factor verification code if you have enabled it.

**Step 2:** Now, you will see the option of "Download Archive." Click on this option and then tap to download the ZIP file on your computer.

![tap on download archive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/use-twitter-archive-5.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once your ZIP file is downloaded, unzip the file by going to the folder where it is saved. Drag the file to a new location and tap on “Extract Here” by right-clicking on the file.

![unzip your archive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/use-twitter-archive-6.jpg)

**Step 4:** Inside the archive, there would be many files and folders such as “tweet\_media," which will contain all the photos and videos you have sent and uploaded from your account. "Your archive.html" is another important folder comprising all of your important data, such as the tweets you have posted, sent messages, and liked posts. Through "README.txt," you will find what every folder contains.

## Part 4: Browse Your Twitter Archive

In this section, we will learn how to browse and check your Twitter archive properly. Your archive file will be open as a web page containing many options for exploration. Through the following listed guidelines, you can browse these tabs by clicking on them:

**Step 1:** From the left section, the first tab is "Account," which will explain all the account details for you. Through this tab, you can explore the following options:

* Tap “Profile” to see your profile details at the time you requested the archive file. This would comprise all the followers and the followings that the account would have at the download request.
* Tap “Contacts” to check the list of contacts to whom you have uploaded across Twitter from the phone or the device that you’ve connected with the platform.
* Tap “Connected Applications” to see all the applications you have given access to to access data from Twitter.
* Tap “Sessions” to check the apps that have accessed your account at different instances.
* Tap “Account Access History” to evaluate all of your login histories across Twitter.
