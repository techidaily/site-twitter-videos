 _We purchased the Logitech C615 Webcam so our expert reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review._

 The inexpensive webcam makes it possible for just about anyone to make a[video call,](https://www.lifewire.com/apps-for-free-video-chat-3426695) stream games on Twitch, or to record a quick video for YouTube. A good webcam has HD resolution, quality sound, and is easy to use. We tested the Logitech C615 Webcam to see whether it can deliver what you need to start recording your videos.

## **Design:** **Flexible, foldable design**

 The Logitech C615 is a compact webcam. The whole device folds up into a very small package, just 2.5” wide, 1.25” tall, and 1.5” wide, so you can tuck it into a pocket. When you open it up, the flexible design is simple to position. Unfolded, the webcam has three pieces: the base, neck, and[camera](https://www.lifewire.com/best-digital-cameras-under-100-3897833) . The base is the heaviest part, which means that the camera stays upright even if you don’t perfectly balance everything. The top is made out of a soft, rubbery plastic, and the bottom has a rubbery dot that keeps the base from sliding around. The dot comes off the base to reveal a tripod post, so this camera is compatible with a standard tripod. The only problem is that the dot comes off completely when the tripod post is exposed. If you're prone to losing things, this may be an issue.

 The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.

 The base’s rubbery surface kept the Logitech C615 From sliding around when we mounted it on our HD TV, even when we moved the USB cable around. The neck is a thin plastic piece that has a lip for mounting the camera to an LCD TV or computer monitor. There are also two rubber strips on the sides to keep it from sliding back and forth when mounted.

 The camera section is made of black plastic with a cropped silver plastic circle around the lens. To the left of the lens there’s an indicator light to show when the camera is on, and the microphone sits to the right of the lens. The 360 swivel not only makes the Logitech C615 easy to position, it also makes it possible to fold the camera lens in on itself to protect it on the go.

## **Camera Quality: Quality camera with some autofocus troubles**

 The camera takes 1080p video and has a 2 MP sensor. We tested the webcam’s photo capabilities by taking a picture of some packaging. Color was well represented, but the autofocus was just a bit off. The image was just a bit blurry, and we couldn’t read the smaller words at all. This wasn’t a problem close up, but it made a bigger difference when people were far away.

 Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow.

 The autofocus also had trouble when there was an object between the camera and the people on which we wanted to focus it. It worked best when we pointed the camera at the background. When a person walked into the shot, the autofocus detected the person and focused on him. When there was a little glare in the background of the shot, the C615 completely blew out those highlights, showing only a bright white light. If you’re going to use this in a fluorescent office with steady, even light it won’t be a problem. Annoying for video chat, but a big problem if you’re using it for YouTube or streaming your game feed.

 The video is 1080p, and looks it. Recorded video was detailed and the focus was sharp as long as the webcam only had one subject to follow, though it does suffer from some minor depth of field issues when multiple people are in frame.

## **Performance: Decent sound quality for a small mic**

 We used both[Photobooth](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436) and[Skype](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508) to test the performance of the C615\. It was very easy to position the camera exactly the way we wanted it, though the USB cable occasionally gave us problems. We’d swivel the camera and then the pull of the USB cable would turn the whole base so the camera pointed back at the same spot where it started.

 When we used Skype to make calls everything worked great. The HD camera made the video look great, and video and sound were in sync. Close up, the sound was clear but with a thin, distorted tone. From 10 feet away, we heard only a small amount of echo in the call. We also tried using the camera mic with video game noise in the background. The camera clearly caught our voices and downplayed the background noise, helping us focus on what we wanted to hear.

## **Price: Inexpensive HD camera**

 The Logitech C615 costs $70 MSRP, but you can find it for about half that cost. Even at full price, it's a solid value. The thoughtful design, image quality, and microphone clarity easily justify the price tag.

## **Competition: Acquits itself well against the competition**

**_Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel_ :** The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the cheapest cameras on the market, going for between $8 and $15\. But there's a reason it retails so cheaply; it's a nightmare to use, the audio quality is torturous, and the camera doesn't approach the advertised 12 MP. Despite being nearly $60 more expensive, the C615 is the obvious winner here.

[Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel Review](https://www.lifewire.com/docooler-usb-20-12-megapixel-review-4784227)

**_Genius 120-degree Webcam_ :** The Genius 120-degree Webcam is a full HD model with a wide-angle lens. Even though its actual field of view is well short of the advertised 120 degrees (in reality, it's closer to 90), it still captures a much wider shot than the Logitech C615, giving it a clear advantage for[conference calls](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-skype-3426903) with large groups of people. At an MSRP of $60, the Genius is a little less expensive, too. The Logitech C615 does has a better, more flexible base than the Genius webcam however, so it's easier to position.

 Final Verdict

 **Strikes a balance between affordability and performance.**

 The Logitech C615 Webcam strikes the perfect balance between performance and affordability. The quality design, high definition video, and quality sound make this an excellent webcam for most tasks at a great price.
