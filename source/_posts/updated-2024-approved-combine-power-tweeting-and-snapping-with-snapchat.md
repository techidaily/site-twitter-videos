The use of social media platforms is limited to sharing posts online but messaging, sending timed pictures, text messages, videos, and sharing all sorts of content is also a part of it. People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.

All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.

## How to Share Videos on Snapchat

The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.

## Record and Send

You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.

After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a 'Your Story' option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.

## Upload from Camera Roll

Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device's storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.

Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.

## How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link

People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.

## Step 2: Find the video and tap share

Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.

The use of social media platforms is limited to sharing posts online but messaging, sending timed pictures, text messages, videos, and sharing all sorts of content is also a part of it. People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.

All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.

## How to Share Videos on Snapchat

The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.

## Record and Send

You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.

After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a 'Your Story' option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.

## Upload from Camera Roll

Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device's storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.

Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.

## How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link

People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.

## Step 2: Find the video and tap share

Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.

## Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu

Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few options for sharing the Twitter video. Select Snapchat from the list; if you do not see Snapchat in that list, go ahead and tap on 'share via.'

![Choose app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-3.jpg)

This will open a list of all applications you can use to share the video. Then all you have to do is select Snapchat from the list.

Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.

## Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link

Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application? Then what?

There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else, but the link embedding does not work.

There is an easy way to overcome this issue if you wish to share Twitter Videos on Snapchat directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on Snapchat without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.

## Step 1: Log in to Twitter

Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.

## Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share

Scroll through your Twitter and locate the video you want to share with your friends on Snapchat. Once you have finalized the video that you wish to share, tap the share icon right below the video.

## Step 3: Copy Link

Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few sharing options for the video. Select the 'Copy Link' option, and the video link will be copied to your device's clipboard.

## Step 4: Open pastedownload.com
