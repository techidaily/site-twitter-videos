Let us consider why people prefer to use a GIF rather than a video.

GIF is one of the most often used file formats in digital life, and it is compatible with practically all platforms and devices.

In short, GIFs are the best way to say everything without saying anything at all. They're quick and punchy. But how can you convert Twitter video to gif and vice versa? What are some of the finest free GIF creators from Twitter videos?

There is no need to be concerned. We'll show you everything you need to know (and more!) about converting your Twitter videos into those adorable little animations known as GIFs.
