### Tip no 4: Size

The dimensions of your thumbnail photo should be as such that they are compatible with all screen sizes as different users will watch the video on different devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc., so you should not crop out the thumbnail in any way.

### Tip no 5: Use a face

It is a part of the human psyche that they are naturally attracted to human faces more than any other graphic or image of any other object. You can always use a face to catch your audience's attention, but make sure the face is related to the video and does not misguide anyone regarding the topic and context of your video.

### Tip no 6: Editing and Color Scheme

Always edit and treat the thumbnail photo beforehand. It should be catchy and compliment the content of the video. Be careful while choosing the color scheme of your photo; you can use a similar color palette as your video, or you can use colors in contrast to the theme of your video. It should not look alien in any way.
