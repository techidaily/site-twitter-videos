As one of the most popular social media platforms, Twitter doesn’t allow people to download videos to their iPhones, just like other social media sites. Because of the stringent copyright rules of Apple, it is impossible to get an app in the App Store that allows converting and downloading Twitter videos. However, what if you want to save Twitter videos to the iPhone for offline watching or share and edit it again with friends? Is there any solution that allows you to download videos from Twitter to iPhone?

Yes, all you need is a **Twitter Video Downloader**.

Basically, the [Documents by Readle app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-6-file-manager-pdf-reader-and-browser/id364901807?mt=8) comes with a built-in browser that downloads or saves the video URL you enter, whereas Chrome or Safari browsers only play the video, rather than allowing you to download/save. The browser works as a video downloader app for you and enables you to save any video, whose URL you have entered there.

Let's know how to save Twitter videos to camera roll with Documents

1. Download the **Documents by Readle** app from the App Store, and then launch Twitter on your iPhone.![Save Twitter Videos Using Documents by Readle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/documents-by-readle1.jpg)
