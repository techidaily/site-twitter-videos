As one of the most popular social media platforms, Twitter doesn’t allow people to download videos to their iPhones, just like other social media sites. Because of the stringent copyright rules of Apple, it is impossible to get an app in the App Store that allows converting and downloading Twitter videos. However, what if you want to save Twitter videos to the iPhone for offline watching or share and edit it again with friends? Is there any solution that allows you to download videos from Twitter to iPhone?

Yes, all you need is a **Twitter Video Downloader**.
