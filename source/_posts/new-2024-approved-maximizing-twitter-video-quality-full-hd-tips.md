### Browser’s Flash

The reason behind this happening might be that the browser’s flash is not enabled. For checking it, you should click on the lock shape icon on the address bar and make sure that the flash is not blocked.

### Old Version

The HD videos on Twitter might not be being played because you have the old version of Chrome. So, make sure there is no compatibility issue. You should update your Chrome and make sure you have the latest version of Chrome installed on your computer/laptop. To check, you need to click on the three dots on the left of the browser.
