**Step 5:** Make sure to download your archive file within a week before it expires. The perfect way to read your archive is through an HTML file.

## Part 4: Browse Your Twitter Archive

In this section, we will learn how to browse and check your Twitter archive properly. Your archive file will be open as a web page containing many options for exploration. Through the following listed guidelines, you can browse these tabs by clicking on them:

**Step 1:** From the left section, the first tab is "Account," which will explain all the account details for you. Through this tab, you can explore the following options:

* Tap “Profile” to see your profile details at the time you requested the archive file. This would comprise all the followers and the followings that the account would have at the download request.
* Tap “Contacts” to check the list of contacts to whom you have uploaded across Twitter from the phone or the device that you’ve connected with the platform.
* Tap “Connected Applications” to see all the applications you have given access to to access data from Twitter.
* Tap “Sessions” to check the apps that have accessed your account at different instances.
* Tap “Account Access History” to evaluate all of your login histories across Twitter.
