In a similar tone, if you want to download a GIF from Twitter on your phone, then you need a special tool or app to customize it according to the device settings.

Let’s see how to save a GIF from Twitter on iPhone first:

**Step 2:** Log in to your Twitter account and reach out for the desired GIF image you want.

**Step 3:** Choose ‘Share Tweet Via’ by tapping the down arrow at the top right side of the screen.
