1. #### Twitter Video Format

One of the most important aspects to consider while fixing this problem is checking if the video that is not being played has the correct format. Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn't have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.

1. #### Flash for Twitter

If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the 'Lock' icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to 'Site Settings.'

In the window of settings, you will find flash in this list. Click the drop-down in front of flash and select 'Allow'.

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png)

This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos. If this was the reason behind the Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, allowing flash will solve this problem.

1. #### Clear Cookies and Cache

Clearing cookies and cache can solve multiple problems related to web browsers. If the above method didn't work for you, try clearing your Chrome browser's cookies and cache. This method will restore any changes or settings that were saved and make your browser load the website in its original form. To do that, go to the setting of Chrome.

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix4.jpg)

Under the setting panel find and choose 'Clear Browsing Data'.

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix5.jpg)

Now select the time range, you should select the 'All time' for the required result and click "Clear Data".

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix6.jpg)

This will definitely solve the problem of videos not playing by returning the website to its original form and restoring all the settings that you might have made.

1. #### Disable Chrome Extensions

1. #### Disable Hardware Acceleration

Is it still not working? Try disabling Hardware Acceleration in your Chrome browser, this might help you play Twitter videos. To Disable Hardware Acceleration, go to the settings of Chrome. In this window of settings, scroll down to advance settings. Under the "System", you disable the "Use Hardware Acceleration When Available". Relaunch the browser after disabling this.

![twitter-video-not-playing-fix9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix9.jpg)

Now try to play the Twitter videos. Hopefully, it will work now. If not then you can try the last step.

1. #### Update your Browser

Are you still facing the same problem with Twitter videos after all the changes? Then the last thing you should try is to update your browser. If you are running an outdated version of Chrome, it might hinder the videos from playing. In addition, the outdated version can make your browser incompatible with Twitter videos. You can quickly check if your browser is an updated version of Chrome or not by clicking on the three dots on the top right corner of the browser. If it shows you an option to update your browser, you are running an outdated Chrome version. Therefore, you should update it as soon as possible to fix all the problems related to it, including playing Twitter videos.
