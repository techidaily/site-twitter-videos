## Tips for Making Good Twitter Reaction Videos

Reaction videos gain tremendous traction, but let's be honest - they're not always that exciting to watch. A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!

### ● The tone is everything

Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don't be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you've ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band's concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.

People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● Be relatable

Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● Keep things fun

A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!

### ● Use your body

Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it's necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you're looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it's likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.

### ● Shoot with clear background

Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.

### ● Avoid background music

Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.

### ● Use effects

Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.

## Conclusion

Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.

For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.

### ● The tone is everything

Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don't be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you've ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band's concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.

People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.

### ● Be relatable

Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.

### ● Shoot with clear background

Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.

### ● Avoid background music

Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.

## Tips for Making Good Twitter Reaction Videos

Reaction videos gain tremendous traction, but let's be honest - they're not always that exciting to watch. A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!

### ● The tone is everything

Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don't be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you've ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band's concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.

People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.

### ● Keep things fun

A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!

### ● Use your body

Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it's necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you're looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it's likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.
