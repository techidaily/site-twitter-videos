If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Flash-for-Twitter"><a href="#Flash-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Flash for Twitter"></a>Flash for Twitter</h4></li></ol><p>If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the ‘Lock’ icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to ‘Site Settings.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix2.jpg"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix2"                ></p><p>In the window of settings, you will find flash in this list.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite-3"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite-3" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-3"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-chuckle-champions-twitters-comedy-corner-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Chuckle-Champions  Twitter’s Comedy Corner for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-social-media-spotlight-10-videos-leading-twitter-chats-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Social Media Spotlight  10 Videos Leading Twitter Chats for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-uniting-twitter-and-facebook-through-shared-content-for-2024/"><u>[New] Uniting Twitter and Facebook Through Shared Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ios-and-android-a-tutorial-for-saving-twitters-animations/"><u>2024 Approved  IOS and Android  A Tutorial for Saving Twitter's Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-direct-sharing-integrating-twitter-video-into-instagram-experience/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Direct Sharing  Integrating Twitter Video Into Instagram Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/swift-sharing-twitter-to-whatsapp-videos/"><u>Swift Sharing  Twitter to WhatsApp Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2023s-quick-share-tweeted-videos-to-whatsapp/"><u>2023'S Quick Share  Tweeted Videos to WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-upload-without-rt-video-tweets/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Upload Without RT  Video Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-instagram-uploading-tweets-videos-directly-for-2024/"><u>[New] Instagram  Uploading Tweets' Videos Directly for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-free-frame-flip-converting-tweets-into-tweenish-movies/"><u>[Updated] Free Frame Flip  Converting Tweets Into Tweenish Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-get-ready-for-seamless-editing-filmora-x-supports-arm/"><u>Updated In 2024, Get Ready for Seamless Editing Filmora X Supports ARM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-cast-infinix-hot-30i-to-computer-for-iphone-and-android-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Cast Infinix Hot 30i to Computer for iPhone and Android?

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-1.jpg"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the video and tap share"></a>Step 2: Find the video and tap share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-2.jpg"                      alt="Tap share"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu"><a href="#Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu"></a>Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu</h2><p>Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few options for sharing the Twitter video. Select Snapchat from the list; if you do not see Snapchat in that list, go ahead and tap on ‘share via.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-3.jpg"                      alt="Choose app"                ></p><p>This will open a list of all applications you can use to share the video. Then all you have to do is select Snapchat from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-4.jpg"                      alt="Choose Snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Step-4-Select-the-Contact"><a href="#Step-4-Select-the-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Select the Contact"></a>Step 4: Select the Contact</h2><p>Tapping on Snapchat will close Twitter and take you to the Snapchat application with a list of all your contacts. From that list, select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with and press send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="Select the Contact"                ></p><p>Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link"></a>Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link</h2><p>Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application? Then what?</p><p>There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else, but the link embedding does not work.</p><p>There is an easy way to overcome this issue if you wish to share Twitter Videos on Snapchat directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on Snapchat without any link.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life.

However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-3"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-3" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-3"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music-3"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music-3" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects-3"><a href="#●-Use-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-correct-aspect-ratio-use-in-micro-video-tweets/"><u>[New] Correct Aspect Ratio Use in Micro-Video Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-exporting-your-youtube-and-twitter-creations-via-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exporting Your YouTube & Twitter Creations via WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-echoes-in-280-characters-viral-video-stories/"><u>[Updated] Echoes in 280 Characters  Viral Video Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveiling-twitters-historical-content-reservoirs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unveiling Twitter's Historical Content Reservoirs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-tweetvid-to-mp4-quick-conversion-tool/"><u>[New] TweetVid to MP4 - Quick Conversion Tool</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/twittersphere-treasures-primes-top-watchers-and-likes-for-2024/"><u>Twittersphere Treasures  Prime’s Top Watchers & Likes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snort-spree-top-10-viral-laughs-online/"><u>[Updated] Snort Spree  Top 10 Viral Laughs Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/three-ways-to-sim-unlock-vivo-y36i-by-drfone-android/"><u>Three Ways to Sim Unlock Vivo Y36i</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-update-iphone-8-plus-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Update iPhone 8 Plus without Data Loss? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-directing-content-flow-uploading-imovie-films-to-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Directing Content Flow  Uploading IMovie Films to YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-heres-how-you-can-ace-the-tiktok-photo-editing-hacks/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Here’s How You Can Ace the TikTok Photo Editing Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-selection-of-windows-friendly-speech-conversion-software/"><u>New In 2024, The Ultimate Selection of Windows-Friendly Speech Conversion Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-basics-of-animated-infographics-and-signage/"><u>In 2024, Basics of Animated Infographics and Signage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-launchpad-gear-list-enhance-your-beginners-gopro-journey/"><u>2024 Approved  Launchpad Gear List - Enhance Your Beginner's GoPro Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unveiling-vsdcs-potential-and-top-alternatives/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unveiling VSDC’s Potential & Top Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-icloud-bypass-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Full guide to Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max iCloud Bypass</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-1.jpg"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the video and tap share"></a>Step 2: Find the video and tap share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-2.jpg"                      alt="Tap share"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu"><a href="#Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu"></a>Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu</h2><p>Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few options for sharing the Twitter video. Select Snapchat from the list; if you do not see Snapchat in that list, go ahead and tap on ‘share via.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-3.jpg"                      alt="Choose app"                ></p><p>This will open a list of all applications you can use to share the video. Then all you have to do is select Snapchat from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-4.jpg"                      alt="Choose Snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Step-4-Select-the-Contact"><a href="#Step-4-Select-the-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Select the Contact"></a>Step 4: Select the Contact</h2><p>Tapping on Snapchat will close Twitter and take you to the Snapchat application with a list of all your contacts. From that list, select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with and press send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="Select the Contact"                ></p><p>Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link"></a>Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link</h2><p>Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application? Then what?</p><p>There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else, but the link embedding does not work.</p><p>There is an easy way to overcome this issue if you wish to share Twitter Videos on Snapchat directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on Snapchat without any link. Just follow the steps below, and you will be all set.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-1"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Log in to your Twitter using your credentials.</p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-Video-and-Tap-Share"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-Video-and-Tap-Share" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share"></a>Step 2: Find the Video and Tap Share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter and locate the video you want to share with your friends on Snapchat.

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat-3"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it.

It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll-3"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll-3" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom.
