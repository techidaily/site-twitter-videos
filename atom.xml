As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you!

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq.

To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd.

It’s a Mini PC in the form of an official Dev Kit, which undercuts (<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1069194734322795598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-computer-laptops/new-inspiron-14-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7441-laptop/useichbts7441hcjp?ref=variantstack" >or at least matches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) the price of even the lower-end Snapdragon X Plus laptops, and it’s set for a full launch on August 23rd, though it’s also already available for pre-order on<a class="link"   href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm" >Arrow.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for just $899 USD.</p><p> We just reviewed a Snapdragon X Elite laptop— the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-xps-13-9345-review" >Dell XPS 13 9345 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — and that unit retails for $1299, which is about $400 pricier for the laptop form factor.</p><h2 id="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications"><a href="#Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications"></a>Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>SoC</strong> : Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X-1E-00-1DE, specs divided between CPU, GPU, and NPU below</li><li><strong>CPU</strong> : Qualcomm Oryon CPU with 12 cores rated at up to 3.8 GHz, or 4.3 with Dual Core Boost; 42 MB cache</li><li><strong>GPU</strong> : Qualcomm Adreno GPU rated for 4.6 Teraflops</li><li><strong>NPU</strong> : Qualcomm Hexagon NPU rated for 45 TOPS</li><li><strong>RAM</strong> : 32GB LPDDR5X RAM</li><li><strong>Storage</strong> : 512 GB “Fast” NVMe SSD</li><li><strong>OS</strong> : Windows 11</li><li><strong>Size</strong> : 199 mm x 175 mm x 35 mm, or 8 x 7 x 1.3 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong> : 970 grams, or ~2.1 lbs</li><li><strong>I&#x2F;O</strong> : 3 USB4 Type-C ports (1 Front), 2 USB 3.2 Type-A ports; 1 Ethernet port; 1 HDMI port; 1 3.5mm audio port</li></ul><p> So, who is this Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite Mini PC really for? As advertised, it’s targeted at developers, which makes sense— if you’re hoping to target ARM-native software for the X Elite chips hitting the laptop or want to properly test and tweak your x86-native software for use with those devices, this seems like the way to go. But if the enhanced AI features (<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/live/copilot-pc-launch-2024" >Copilot+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) of the Snapdragon X Elite happen to hold particularly high appeal to you and your workflows, that’s another reason this piece of kit could be compelling.</p><p> For gaming purposes, we definitely wouldn’t recommend the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite platform at this time. While it’s true that some games work and even the new image scaling options added just for Windows ARM and these devices are compelling, the overall gaming performance and compatibility of Snapdragon X Elite just isn’t competitive with x86 gaming laptops at this time. Other iGPUs—<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-suffer-compatibility-issues-with-many-games#xenforo-comments-3848147" >even_Intel_ iGPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — provide a much better experience.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> But it’s not all doom and gloom in the world of Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops — or Mini PCs in this case — as long as you have the requisite monitor and peripherals to get it up and running. You generally have a pretty usable version of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here, and a number of productivity and creative applications that will work perfectly fine.

This video demo should not be mistaken for an actually-viable<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/mini-pc" >Mini PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> project, and does not constitute any<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-pc-case-fans-for-airflow-and-performance" >PC cooling advice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> 苏打baka’s name is a combination of the Chinese characters for “soda” and Japanese-Romanized “baka” meaning “fool”, so their name can effectively be translated as “Sodabaka”, “Sodafool”, or “Soda-foolish”, depending on how semantic you feel like being. We’ll use Sodabaka. Besides this project, they also do lots of other PC hardware and gaming-centric content on<a class="link"   href="https://space.bilibili.com/691415738" >their Bilibili channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Image 1 of 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Shots of the Fan PC build from throughout the original video."                ></p><p> (Image credit: 苏打baka on Bilibili)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Shots of the Fan PC build from throughout the original video."                ></p><p> (Image credit: 苏打baka on Bilibili)</p><p> Now, let’s talk a little more about the details of the PC build in question. Sodabaka essentially took an old Intel Sandybridge-era<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-mini-itx-pc-cases" >Mini ITX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> motherboard and tested its operation while attached to a spinning fan.</p><p> The first attempt at this used a smaller CPU heatsink that didn’t adequately cool the system, even while it was spinning, with tests showing the processor reaching 100 degrees Celsius. However, this did function as a general proof of concept that you could make a PC spin violently at the center of a fan and still have it operate without issue.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> So, when moving onto the final testing of the fan PC build, Sodabaka instead used an even larger passive air cooler — which may have been a good idea, if the final testing of the PC build didn’t also include steadily ramping up the speed of fan upon which the entire PC spins. While the beefier-cooler version of the fan PC does seemed to work, as far as its principle functionality went, its final testing run ended in disaster.</p><p> So, what happened? Did the static buildup short out the PC or something? Fortunately, nothing so mundane. Instead, the fan PC was tested at increasingly higher speeds until the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/noctua-fanless-cooler-enters-production" >weighty cooler <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was violently flung from the PC in the last moments of the original video. No wonder Sodabaka hid behind a riot shield for much of the video demo.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-easy-process-how-to-save-twitter-videos-on-an-android-device-for-2024/"><u>[New] Easy Process How to Save Twitter Videos on an Android Device for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-is-av1-the-clear-winner-against-vp9/"><u>[New] Is AV1 The Clear Winner Against VP9?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-the-art-of-twitters-live-video-engagement-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Mastering the Art of Twitter's Live Video Engagement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-prime-5-replacements-for-twitter-users-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Prime 5 Replacements for Twitter Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-make-money-on-tiktok-in-8-ways-cannot-miss/"><u>2024 Approved How to Make Money on TikTok in 8 Ways [Cannot Miss]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-workaround-twitter-videos-in-chrome-problem/"><u>2024 Approved Workaround Twitter Videos in Chrome Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-info.techidaily.com/effortless-guide-mastering-cd-burning-techniques-in-windows-11/"><u>Effortless Guide: Mastering CD Burning Techniques in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/expert-screenshot-solutions-reviewed/"><u>Expert Screenshot Solutions Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/hard-resetting-an-vivo-s18-device-made-easy-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>Hard Resetting an Vivo S18 Device Made Easy | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-popular-tiktok-creations-dominating-twitter-discussions/"><u>In 2024, Popular TikTok Creations Dominating Twitter Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/intuitive-driving-meets-innovation-mercedes-benzs-latest-feature-voice-controlled-chatgpt-system/"><u>Intuitive Driving Meets Innovation: Mercedes-Benz's Latest Feature - Voice-Controlled ChatGPT System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/social-synergy-sharing-tweets-as-snaps-in-2e-2023-for-2024/"><u>Social Synergy Sharing Tweets as Snaps in 2E 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/spotting-and-skipping-fraudulent-chatgpt-clones-in-the-apple-app-ecosystem/"><u>Spotting and Skipping Fraudulent ChatGPT Clones in the Apple App Ecosystem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/unleashing-sound-in-social-video-sharing-platforms-for-2024/"><u>Unleashing Sound in Social Video Sharing Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/video-not-playing-overcome-code-224003/"><u>Video Not Playing: Overcome Code 224003</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983588">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983588">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983588.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983588%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983588/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. Tumblr</h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. Plurk</h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device. Although it doesn’t offer the same features as Twitter, Musical.ly is still an interesting alternative for this declining social network.</p><h4 id="4-Gab-ai"><a href="#4-Gab-ai" class="headerlink" title="4. Gab.ai"></a>4. Gab.ai</h4><p>Free speech supporters are going to love using Gab.ai, a social network that has had their mobile app banned from both Google Play and the App Store, for failing to comply with their policies on adult content. Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. Instagram</h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram. The social media platform supports sponsored content as well as ads, which makes it a perfect choice for everyone who wants to develop their business.</p><p>What is your favorite Twitter alternative?

However, you can insert “+something” between your username and the @gmail extension to create email aliases which Gmail just regards the them as the same address and delivers the email directly to your nomal Gmail account. All emails from your new Twitter account will be sent to your original email address, even though you added the “+something” to it.

Now, drag the handles inward or outward to position the video.</p><p><strong>● Step 3: Use editing tools</strong></p><p>There are over 60 motion effects, numerous transitions, and visual effects to add flair and appeal to your reaction video.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter has also jumped on the short video bandwagon to join TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-3"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-3" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-3"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music-3"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music-3" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects-3"><a href="#●-Use-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-crafting-twitreacts/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Crafting TwitReacts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ubscriber-threshold-raised-for-profits-for-2024/"><u>[New] Subscriber Threshold Raised for Profits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-chronicles-of-charms-a-compreentic-toolkit-for-twitters-visual-treasures/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Chronicles of Charms A Compreentic Toolkit for Twitter's Visual Treasures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-secrets-unveiled-saving-twitter-gifs-for-later-use/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Secrets Unveiled Saving Twitter GIFs for Later Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/free-downloader-turn-youtube-audio-into-premium-mp3s-for-2024/"><u>Best Free Downloader Turn YouTube Audio Into Premium MP3s for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-astral-adventures-with-your-luxury-sj4000-essential-accompaniments/"><u>In 2024, Astral Adventures with Your Luxury SJ4000 - Essential Accompaniments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-sim-cards-of-poco-x5-pro-without-puk-codes-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock SIM Cards Of Poco X5 Pro Without PUK Codes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-whats-trending-on-tiktok-and-twittersphere/"><u>In 2024, What's Trending on TikTok and Twittersphere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/resolving-the-last-round-mishap-a-guide-to-overcoming-error-code-tfla0002/"><u>Resolving the Last Round Mishap: A Guide to Overcoming Error Code TFLA0002</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/secure-and-improve-yoga-900s-download-official-windows-10-drivers/"><u>Secure & Improve Yoga 900S: Download Official Windows 10 Drivers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-1.jpg"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the video and tap share"></a>Step 2: Find the video and tap share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-2.jpg"                      alt="Tap share"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu"><a href="#Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu"></a>Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu</h2><p>Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few options for sharing the Twitter video.

From that list, select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with and press send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="Select the Contact"                ></p><p>Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link"></a>Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link</h2><p>Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application?

But we have got you.</p><p>Now that you know all methods of sharing Twitter Videos on Snapchat, with or without the link, follow the steps mentioned above, and it will save you and your friends from the nuisance caused by inter-platform video sharing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-restore-original-sound-in-tweet-video-links/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Restore Original Sound in Tweet Video Links</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-thriving-in-twitter-live-tv-mode/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Thriving in Twitter Live TV Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-avoid-buffering-switch-av1-codec-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Avoid Buffering Switch AV1 Codec on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-eliminate-hurdle-video-playback-issue-in-chrome/"><u>[New] In 2024, Eliminate Hurdle Video Playback Issue in Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-twitters-promotional-features/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Twitter's Promotional Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-iphone-footage-filming-and-slowing-down-videos/"><u>[New] Transform Your iPhone Footage Filming and Slowing Down Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-whats-captivating-twitter-users-the-most/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved What's Captivating Twitter Users the Most?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-best-bites-outside-the-box-new-film-favorites-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best Bites Outside the Box New Film Favorites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-become-a-streaming-sensation-on-twitter-platform/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Become a Streaming Sensation on Twitter Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-fix-there-is-no-sound-on-twitter-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Fix There Is No Sound on Twitter Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-twittableplustumble-posting-videos-easily/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Twittable+Tumble Posting Videos Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/detailed-dissection-what-makes-obs-a-top-recorder-in-2024/"><u>Detailed Dissection What Makes OBS a Top Recorder, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-easily-hard-reset-my-zte-nubia-flip-5g-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Easily Hard reset my ZTE Nubia Flip 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Xiaomi Redmi 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-essential-handbook-for-periscope-video-logging/"><u>In 2024, The Essential Handbook for Periscope Video Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-discover-the-top-10-digital-audio-workstations-for-pc-and-mac-windowsmac-updated-edition-for-2024/"><u>New Discover the Top 10 Digital Audio Workstations for PC and Mac (Windows/Mac) - Updated Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/reevaluating-trust-zerogpt-and-comparable-detection-tech/"><u>Reevaluating Trust: ZeroGPT & Comparable Detection Tech</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352555/5172" target="_top" id="352555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352555/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049390/7443" target="_top" id="2049390">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049390" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049390/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game.

In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq.

To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-advanced-recording-strategies-for-effective-ppt-dissemination/"><u>[New] Advanced Recording Strategies for Effective PPT Dissemination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-breezy-methodology-for-downloading-twitters-laughs-gifs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Breezy Methodology for Downloading Twitter's Laughs (GIFs) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/utting-edge-editors-elevating-online-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Editors Elevating Online Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamlined-scheduling-making-the-most-of-zoom-calls/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamlined Scheduling Making the Most of Zoom Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-laughter-laborer-spooky-cyborgs/"><u>[New] Laughter Laborer Spooky Cyborgs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-definitive-path-from-twitter-video-to-creatively-crafted-gifs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Definitive Path From Twitter Video to Creatively Crafted GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tweet-to-whatsapp-video-dissemination-methods/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Tweet-to-WhatsApp Video Dissemination Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-essential-guide-to-video-spinning-in-vlc-media-player/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Essential Guide to Video Spinning in VLC Media Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/essential-guide-to-twitter-videos-and-aspect-ratios-for-2024/"><u>Essential Guide to Twitter Videos and Aspect Ratios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/get-your-copy-of-immortals-fenyx-rising-running-issue-resolved/"><u>Get Your Copy of Immortals Fenyx Rising Running - Issue Resolved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/how-secure-is-duckduckgo-as-a-privacy-focused-search-engine/"><u>How Secure Is DuckDuckGo as a Privacy-Focused Search Engine?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-tweeted-visuals-ultimate-gif-saver-guide/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Tweeted Visuals Ultimate GIF Saver Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-tips-for-crafting-viral-twitter-campaigns/"><u>In 2024, Expert Tips for Crafting Viral Twitter Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-html-formatting-and-styling/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Art of HTML Formatting and Styling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-tweet-talent-showdown-1-10-edition/"><u>In 2024, Top Tweet Talent Showdown #1-#10 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-xiaomi-redmi-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Xiaomi Redmi 12? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/mastering-hitman-3-avoiding-pc-malfunctions-and-game-crashes-updated-guide/"><u>Mastering Hitman 3: Avoiding PC Malfunctions & Game Crashes (Updated Guide)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/the-compre-written-in-html-a-journey-through-web-content-creation/"><u>The Compre Written in HTML A Journey Through Web Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/the-digital-symphony-blizzard-and-microsoft-harmonize-gaming-and-ai-mastery-podcast-exploration/"><u>The Digital Symphony: Blizzard and Microsoft Harmonize Gaming & AI Mastery [Podcast Exploration]</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-guffaw-gazette-twitters-funniest-threads/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Guffaw Gazette Twitter's Funniest Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-nailing-the-perfect-aspect-ratio-on-tweets/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Nailing the Perfect Aspect Ratio on Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tiktoks-biggest-winners-on-the-twittersphere/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved TikTok's Biggest Winners on the Twittersphere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-expert-tips-to-transform-lengthy-videos-into-engaging-segmented-content/"><u>[New] In 2024, Expert Tips to Transform Lengthy Videos Into Engaging, Segmented Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-quick-guide-to-record-google-meet-in-your-browser/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Quick Guide to Record Google Meet in Your Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unfolding-the-digital-canvas-vr-evolution/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unfolding the Digital Canvas VR Evolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-video-titans-the-tweeted-and-tested-binge-masters/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Video Titans The #Tweeted and Tested Binge Masters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unleashing-the-potential-of-your-social-media-past/"><u>2024 Approved Unleashing the Potential of Your Social Media Past</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/device-unlock-magic-5-by-drfone-android-unlock-android-unlock/"><u>Device unlock Magic 5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-lock-screen-settings-on-your-samsung-galaxy-a15-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>Everything You Need to Know about Lock Screen Settings on your Samsung Galaxy A15 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-preventing-hell-let-loose-game-crashes-on-your-desktop-computer/"><u>Expert Tips for Preventing Hell Let Loose Game Crashes on Your Desktop Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-sync-fix-twitter-vids-and-chrome/"><u>In 2024, Sync Fix Twitter Vids and Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-definitive-handbook-to-reacting-on-youtube-tweets/"><u>In 2024, The Definitive Handbook to Reacting on YouTube Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ring-your-youtube-live-video-thumbnail-game-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Your YouTube Live Video Thumbnail Game for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-popular.techidaily.com/problembehandlung-wenn-das-iphone-videowiedergabe-nicht-ladt-hilfe-und-ratschlage/"><u>Problembehandlung: Wenn Das iPhone-Videowiedergabe Nicht Lädt – Hilfe Und Ratschläge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/tweet-treasure-trove-the-most-popular-tweeps-for-2024/"><u>Tweet Treasure Trove The Most Popular Tweeps for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Twitter has also jumped on the short video bandwagon to join TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-3"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music-3"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music-3" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects-3"><a href="#●-Use-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip. And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-funniest-punchlines-reddit-vs-twitter-memes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Funniest Punchlines Reddit Vs.
