The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139112/17108" target="_top" id="2139112">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139112" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139112/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5.

It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation.

Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-2"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-2"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist.

Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot.

The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don’t post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfollow-apps-twitter.jpg"                      alt="unfollow apps"                ></p><p>If you are having a tough time deciding which <strong>unfollow apps</strong> you should use, you are at the right place because in this article we are going to present top seven options that are currently available at the market.</p><p>Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.</p><h2 id="7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter"><a href="#7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter"></a>7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter</h2><p>Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.</p><h4 id="1-SocialOopmph"><a href="#1-SocialOopmph" class="headerlink" title="1.

Well, it is more of a public app meant for sharing Tweets and not messages.</p><p>Suppose you need to share something with your friends or anyone else. In that case, the wisest way to do so is to send them a link on a messaging platform almost everyone uses.

Then what?</p><p>There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880960/19272" target="_top" id="1880960">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880960" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880960/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

One is by using the Tweet Video option, and the other is by using the Shortcuts app on iPhone. This article shows how you can do that by using both methods.</p><h3 id="1-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Tweet-Video-Option"><a href="#1-Sharing-Twitter-Videos-with-the-Tweet-Video-Option" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor.

To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-1"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile-1" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-1"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-1" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-1"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-1"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-1" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have.

Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor.

So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037346/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-2"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-2" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time.

If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have. This feature allows you to share any Twitter video without retweeting. However, this is quite a nice hack that allows you to reap the same results. Here is how you can share a Twitter video without retweeting:</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure the Twitter app is installed on your phone.</li><li>Open the Twitter app and locate the video you want to share.</li><li>Once you find the video, open the tweet and tap on the small <strong>share icon</strong>under the Tweet.</li><li>This will show you several options. Tap on <strong>Copy Link to Tweet.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-1.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now go back to the main page and type a new Tweet.</li><li>Compose your Tweet and then paste the URL that you copied.</li><li>Then you need to edit the URL that you pasted. Remove the parameters at the end that is “?s&#x3D;20”.</li><li>After removing, write in place of it “&#x2F;video&#x2F;1”.</li><li>For example if the URL is “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/" >https://twitter.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><username>&#x2F;status&#x2F;1234567890?s&#x3D;”</li><li>Then replace it with “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1" >https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-2.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now click on the <strong>Tweet</strong>button to post your Tweet.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-3.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><p>And that’s it!

Here is how you can Tweet a video with the Shortcuts app:</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure you have the Shortcuts app installed on your iPhone. If you don’t have it, you can easily install it from the Apple store.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-8.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Next, open your phone’s browser and open <a class="link"   href="https://www.tvdl.app/" >https://www.tvdl.app/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Such is the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar" >MSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s MEG Vision X AI Desktop, which we stumbled upon in the company’s sprawling booth.</p><p> Due out in Q4 for an undisclosed price, the MEG Vision X will have, according to MSI reps “the latest” Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU at the time, which implies that it will have an Arrow Lake processor and a 5080 or 5090 card (presuming Nvidia announces one this fall). With all that horsepower, you could use this system to play high-end games, train models or just process a little local AI generated art.</p><p> But what makes the MEG Vision X stand out is not its ability to run AI or gaming tasks – any PC with a decent video card or an NPU could do that. It’s the 1080 x 1920 touch screen that takes up the entire front surface of the chassis that led us to name this desktop one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/best-of-computex-2024" >best products of Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The chassis with built-in screen is so impressive to look at that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed his name and the word “awesome” on the top of the Meg Vision X when he visited MSI’s booth.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYkvUDqMNVz6ycnx4BZFYV-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X with Gelsinger Signature"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> By default, the touch display shows key PC stats such as your CPU temperature and clock speed. It also allows you to launch your favorite apps on your primary screen by tapping a shortcut icon. You can change performance modes here as well, opting for more speed or quieter fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SRaW8dq9GVUxC4BK2xbzh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The display is seen by Windows as a full-fledged second display in portrait mode. So you can play YouTube videos on it or run apps on it if you wish. MSI reps said a game streamer should keep their chat or OBS window on the front-panel screen while gaming on their primary monitor. They also said that the touch screen uses Intel integrated graphics while the main monitor or any secondary monitors you attach would use the Nvidia graphics card.</p><p> We got to spend a few minutes with the MSI MEG Vision X and its touch screen and we were impressed with how responsive it was. We put a YouTube vertical video onto the touch screen and then swiped down to switch to a different one.

The screen itself is called an AI HMI and some of the shortcuts on it launch built-in MSI AI apps such as AI Artist x MSI Chat, which is a chat bot &#x2F; image generator that runs locally. A built-in microphone and speaker will let you issue voice commands either to MSI’s app or to Copilot.</p><p> There’s also MSI AI Engine, which adjusts performance based on AI. Then there’s AI Frozr, which does the same thing for cooling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naxGXKocxiSqBdGWe9LHqR-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> But even if having a local image generator &#x2F; chatbot is really valuable to you, you don’t need a special PC or an on-case screen on the case to get those features. MSI may have its own branded apps, but it’s likely using the same chat and image generation that’s available elsewhere. Anyone who has a decent graphics card can download and install Stable Diffusion image generator or LLama for chat. If you have an RTX card, try<a class="link"   href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI" >ComfyUI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a very powerful frontend for Stable Diffusion.</p><p> What you can’t get elsewhere is a full HD screen that takes up the entire front surface of your chassis. We have seen some cases with screens on the front – the<a class="link"   href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/D41MESHSCREENBlack.html" >Jonsbo D41 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes to mind. But MSI’s display takes up the entire space and is meant to be an integral part of the user experience, not just a cute special effect.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vimeos-complimentary-guide-essential-video-editing-skills/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Vimeo’s Complimentary Guide Essential Video Editing Skills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-comedy-kings-and-queens-whos-tops/"><u>[New] Comedy Kings and Queens Who's Tops?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-fix-disruption-chromium-and-tweeted-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Fix Disruption Chromium and Tweeted Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-leveraging-twitters-visual-content-on-snapchat/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Leveraging Twitter's Visual Content on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-productions-with-key-obs-studio-tips/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Productions with Key OBS Studio Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-studio-sound-techniques-mac-basics/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Studio Sound Techniques Mac Basics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tweet-town-ranking-the-trending-threads/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tweet Town Ranking the Trending Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unleashing-creativity-filming-timelapse-videography-on-ipad/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unleashing Creativity Filming Timelapse Videography on iPad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/from-waste-to-wonder-achieving-true-to-life-texture-appearance-and-smell-of-wood-through-3d-printing-with-sawdust-ink/"><u>From Waste to Wonder: Achieving True-to-Life Texture, Appearance, and Smell of Wood Through 3D Printing with Sawdust Ink</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-infinix-zero-5g-2023-turbo-frp-in-3-different-ways-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Bypass Infinix Zero 5G 2023 Turbo FRP In 3 Different Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/skyline-your-tweets-elevating-twitter-streams/"><u>Skyline Your Tweets Elevating Twitter Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/unlocking-made-easy-the-best-10-apps-for-unlocking-your-infinix-note-30-vip-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>Unlocking Made Easy The Best 10 Apps for Unlocking Your Infinix Note 30 VIP Device</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557746/17382" target="_top" id="1557746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557746/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484945/16446" target="_top" id="1484945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484945/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037359/7443" target="_top" id="2037359">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037359" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037359/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141687/17094" target="_top" id="2141687">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141687" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141687/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-convert-tweety-movies-to-audible-files/"><u>[New] In 2024, Convert Tweety Movies to Audible Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-list-of-tiktok-phenomena-on-twitter/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate List of TikTok Phenomena on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-maintain-proper-aspect-ratio-for-tweeted-movies/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Maintain Proper Aspect Ratio for Tweeted Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-most-improved-10-elements-of-terraria/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Most Improved 10 Elements of Terraria</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-secrets-to-capturing-your-iphone-7-screen/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Secrets to Capturing Your iPhone 7 Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tweeted-trailblazers-cutting-edge-strategies-to-save-tweets-on-screen/"><u>[Updated] Tweeted Trailblazers Cutting-Edge Strategies to Save Tweets on Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/get-rid-of-the-standout-wallpaper-icon-in-win11/"><u>Get Rid of the Standout Wallpaper Icon in Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-check-distance-and-radius-on-google-maps-for-your-vivo-y36-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Check Distance and Radius on Google Maps For your Vivo Y36 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-google-pixel-fold-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Google Pixel Fold | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-harness-the-power-of-twitch-livestream-tips-and-tricks/"><u>In 2024, Harness the Power of Twitch Livestream Tips & Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-6-best-sim-unlock-services-that-actually-work-on-your-honor-x9b-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The 6 Best SIM Unlock Services That Actually Work On Your Honor X9b Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/unlocking-game-speed-in-roblox-a-review/"><u>Unlocking Game Speed in Roblox: A Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Transform-Your-Tunes-with-Our-Newly-Launched-Open-Source-Tulip-Creative-PC-Running-MicroPython-All-for-Only-59-Dollars"><a href="#Transform-Your-Tunes-with-Our-Newly-Launched-Open-Source-Tulip-Creative-PC-Running-MicroPython-All-for-Only-59-Dollars" class="headerlink" title="Transform Your Tunes with Our Newly Launched Open-Source Tulip Creative PC Running MicroPython, All for Only 59 Dollars"></a>Transform Your Tunes with Our Newly Launched Open-Source Tulip Creative PC Running MicroPython, All for Only 59 Dollars</h2><p>For just $59, musicians now have a new option for a purpose-built musical computer with a touchscreen and music synthesizer— meet the<a class="link"   href="https://tulip.computer/" >Tulip Creative Computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , a FOSS (Free and Open Source) project available as a pre-made purchase in free software form for existing PCs and Macs, or even fully buildable at home to those with the resources and know-how to get it done.</p><p> A simple dual-core powers the Tulip PC, 250 MHz ESP32-S3 with 8.5 MB of RAM and 32 MB of storage connected to a 7-inch, 30 Hz IPS touchscreen running at a 1024 x 600 resolution. These specs are pretty light by modern standards, but they seem sensible for a device tailored purely to making or playing music with attached keyboards, MIDI devices, and speakers.</p><p> Per the official page, the primary purpose of the Tulip computer is to make and play music. Still, its support for Python programming also makes it capable of displaying a variety of sprites, PNGs, backgrounds, etc— which means even lightweight games should be makeable or playable on the device. There’s no real multimedia or web browsing functionality here besides. However, Tulip also has access to an exclusive BBS Tulip WORLD system for sharing music files and chatting with other users.</p><p> Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/1lYFjQp7Xrw/maxresdefault.jpg"                      alt="Tulip, a musical computer based on Micropython - YouTube"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/1lYFjQp7Xrw" >Watch On <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The synthesizer at the heart of Tulip is the AMY (Addictive Music synthesizer librarY), another FOSS project made to be integrated across “almost any program, architecture, or microcontroller” and usable as an FM synthesizer, analog-type synthesizer, drum machine, or even a breakpoint synthesizer. AMY is also used by the FOSS mesh synthesizer project Alles (think FOSS wireless speaker mesh solution), which Tulip Creative Computers also supports.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> For musicians comfortable with Python or FOSS hardware and software solutions, the Tulip project seems like a nifty piece of purpose-built hardware (or software if you prefer not to buy or build anything), ideal for essential music production or simple coding projects.</p><p> When it comes to specialized hardware like this (or retro PC hardware in general), “necessity is the mother of invention” and “limitations foster creativity.” It would be interesting to see some rudimentary arcade or DOS game ports on this machine— a dual-core 250 MHz microcontroller may not sound like a lot today, but in the 80s, even 16 MHz was considered cutting-edge.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-twitters-live-video-engagement/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Twitter's Live Video Engagement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-no-cash-all-fun-turning-twitter-vids-into-gifs-for-2024/"><u>[New] No Cash, All Fun Turning Twitter Vids Into GIFs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-vimeoifytweets-video-to-mp3-and-mp4/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved VimeoifyTweets Video-to-MP3 & MP4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-harnessing-video-magic-channel-creation-wizardry-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Harnessing Video Magic Channel Creation Wizardry for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-laugh-ledger-the-ultimate-list-of-hilarious-tweet-threads/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Laugh Ledger The Ultimate List of Hilarious Tweet Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-laugh-riot-twitters-funniest-moments-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Laugh Riot Twitter's Funniest Moments for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-blog.techidaily.com/accelerated-launch-timelines-for-global-beer-brands-using-abbyy-technology/"><u>Accelerated Launch Timelines for Global Beer Brands Using ABBYY Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/highest-rated-10-apps-to-watch-golf-and-soccer-in-the-moment-for-2024/"><u>Highest Rated 10 Apps to Watch Golf & Soccer in the Moment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-do-you-get-sun-stone-evolutions-in-pokemon-for-vivo-y77t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Vivo Y77t?

This video demo should not be mistaken for an actually-viable<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/mini-pc" >Mini PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> project, and does not constitute any<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-pc-case-fans-for-airflow-and-performance" >PC cooling advice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> 苏打baka’s name is a combination of the Chinese characters for “soda” and Japanese-Romanized “baka” meaning “fool”, so their name can effectively be translated as “Sodabaka”, “Sodafool”, or “Soda-foolish”, depending on how semantic you feel like being. We’ll use Sodabaka. Besides this project, they also do lots of other PC hardware and gaming-centric content on<a class="link"   href="https://space.bilibili.com/691415738" >their Bilibili channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Image 1 of 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Shots of the Fan PC build from throughout the original video."                ></p><p> (Image credit: 苏打baka on Bilibili)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Shots of the Fan PC build from throughout the original video."                ></p><p> (Image credit: 苏打baka on Bilibili)</p><p> Now, let’s talk a little more about the details of the PC build in question. Sodabaka essentially took an old Intel Sandybridge-era<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-mini-itx-pc-cases" >Mini ITX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> motherboard and tested its operation while attached to a spinning fan.</p><p> The first attempt at this used a smaller CPU heatsink that didn’t adequately cool the system, even while it was spinning, with tests showing the processor reaching 100 degrees Celsius. However, this did function as a general proof of concept that you could make a PC spin violently at the center of a fan and still have it operate without issue.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> So, when moving onto the final testing of the fan PC build, Sodabaka instead used an even larger passive air cooler — which may have been a good idea, if the final testing of the PC build didn’t also include steadily ramping up the speed of fan upon which the entire PC spins. While the beefier-cooler version of the fan PC does seemed to work, as far as its principle functionality went, its final testing run ended in disaster.</p><p> So, what happened? Did the static buildup short out the PC or something? Fortunately, nothing so mundane.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144299/7443" target="_top" id="2144299">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144299" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144299/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you!

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game.

In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion.

To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-serene-pc-gaming/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Ultimate List of Serene PC Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-8-facebook-link-exporters-download-and-manage-effortlessly/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Top 8 Facebook Link Exporters Download & Manage Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-flawless-frequency-facilitator-for-voices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Flawless Frequency Facilitator for Voices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unfreeze-non-playing-youtube-tweets-chrome/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unfreeze Non-Playing YouTube Tweets Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-effortless-multichannel-publishing-tweets-plus-tumbles/"><u>[Updated] Effortless Multichannel Publishing Tweets + Tumbles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-videotwit2mp4-simple-conversion/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, VideoTwit2MP4 Simple Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-recode-video-files-to-audio-outputs/"><u>[Updated] Recode Video Files to Audio Outputs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-complete-guide-to-twitter-archive-mastery/"><u>2024 Approved A Complete Guide to Twitter Archive Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twitters-new-era-of-videography-aspect-ratios-mandatory/"><u>2024 Approved Twitter's New Era of Videography Aspect Ratios Mandatory</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/1722970216470-easy-to-download-csr-bluetooth-driver-software-now-online/"><u>Easy-to-Download CSR Bluetooth Driver Software Now Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/effortless-media-transfer-twitter-videos-on-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>Effortless Media Transfer Twitter Videos on WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/cing-clicks-youtube-thumbnail-sizes-explored/"><u>Enhancing Clicks YouTube Thumbnail Sizes Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-rgbs-role-in-modern-color-standards-compared-to-srgb/"><u>In 2024, Rgb's Role in Modern Color Standards Compared to Srgb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-vivo-s18e-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Vivo S18e</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-what-is-fake-gps-location-pro-and-is-it-good-on-samsung-galaxy-f04-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, What is Fake GPS Location Pro and Is It Good On Samsung Galaxy F04? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/most-asked-questions-about-pokemon-go-battle-league-rewards-on-apple-iphone-12-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Most Asked Questions about Pokemon Go Battle League Rewards On Apple iPhone 12 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/viral-video-explosion-twitters-hot-tiktoks-listed-for-2024/"><u>Viral Video Explosion Twitter’s Hot TikToks Listed for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This tiny PC weighs just 2.6 kg and comes in a 2.5-liter chassis that measures 270 x 180 x 50mm. Even though it has a diminutive form factor, you won’t miss out on performance as it comes with either an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H or a Core Ultra 9 185H. Both models also have a discrete GPU — an RTX 4060 for the Ultra 7 and RTX 4070 for the Ultra 9.</p><p> Intel left the mini-PC business in July 2023, licensing its<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nuc-is-now-officially-part-of-the-asus-product-lineup" >NUC brand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Asus and allowing it to continue the line of tiny computers. Asus teased an<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/asus-teases-rog-nuc-ready-to-be-unveiled-on-january-8" >ROG <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> version of the NUC in January 2024, and after six months, it’s finally ready to release a retail version of its first gaming mini-PC.</p><p>These are the specifications of the two Asus ROG NUC models:</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Model #</th><th>RNUC14SRKU7168AUI</th><th>RNUC14SRKU9189AUI</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel Core Ultra 7 155H</td><td>Intel Core Ultra 9 185H</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics Card</td><td>RTX 4060</td><td>RTX 4070</td></tr><tr><td>Memory [Upgradeable to (32GB x 2)]</td><td>(8GB x 2) DDR5-5600</td><td>(8GB x 2) DDR5-5600</td></tr><tr><td>Storage [3x M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4 slots available]</td><td>1x 512GB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4</td><td>512GB M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless</td><td>Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</td><td>Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3</td></tr><tr><td>LAN</td><td>2.5G Intel LAN</td><td>2.5G Intel LAN</td></tr><tr><td>Audio</td><td>Realtek&#x2F;ALC256</td><td>Realtek&#x2F;ALC256</td></tr><tr><td>Front I&#x2F;O Ports</td><td>1x SD Card Reader, 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack</td><td>1x SD Card Reader, 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack</td></tr><tr><td>Rear I&#x2F;O Ports</td><td>1x Thunderbolt 4&#x2F;USB4 Type-C port (with DP2.1 and 12V fast charging), 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x HDMI 2.1, 2x DP1.4a port, 1x 2.5G RJ45 LAN, 1x DC in barrel jack port, 1x Kensington Lock slot</td><td>1x Thunderbolt 4&#x2F;USB4 Type-C port (with DP2.1 and 12V fast charging), 2x USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, 2x USB 2.0 Type-A, 1x HDMI 2.1, 2x DP1.4a port, 1x 2.5G RJ45 LAN, 1x DC in barrel jack port, 1x Kensington Lock slot</td></tr><tr><td>Power Supply</td><td>330W power adapter</td><td>330W power adapter</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$1,629.00</td><td>$2,199.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p> Since this is also an ROG product, you get gaming-specific features, like ARGB lights on the ROG logo at the top or side panel (depending on how you orient the mini-PC). Asus even says that you have the option to create your own logo, although there’s no indication yet of how to do that.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Although the ROG NUC is a tiny computer, it can accommodate up to four 4K displays via the HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB4 ports. However, we wouldn’t recommend that configuration for gaming as an RTX 4070 might be a little bit hard-pressed to deliver that many pixels.</p><p> You can now see both devices on the<a class="link"   href="https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=332082&a=2384895&epi=tomshardware-us-6479410811963061514&url=https://rog.asus.com/us/desktops/mini-pc/rog-nuc/" >Asus website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , but they’re marked as ‘Temporarily Out of Stock.’ Nevertheless, if you’re looking for a tiny gaming PC, you can ask Asus to notify you when they become available. You should also prepare your wallet if you want this device with its high starting price. It does come with a discrete GPU, though, unlike other mini-PC designs, where you need an eGPU dock to enjoy high-quality graphics.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-guide-to-snagging-twitter-gifs-pc/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Expert Guide to Snagging Twitter GIFs (PC)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-companies-for-haptic-rich-views-for-2024/"><u>[New] Pioneering Companies for Haptic-Rich Views for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-dominate-youtube-traffic-with-proficient-use-of-creator-studio/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Dominate YouTube Traffic with Proficient Use of Creator Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-hitting-the-high-notes-in-instagram-photography/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Hitting the High Notes in Instagram Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-tweaking-your-tweets-audience-engagement-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Tweaking Your Tweets Audience Engagement Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-keeping-up-with-aspect-ratios-for-twitter-content/"><u>[Updated] Keeping Up with Aspect Ratios for Twitter Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snort-spree-twitters-funniest-humor-chronicles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Snort Spree Twitter’s Funniest Humor Chronicles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-the-animators-guide-to-elite-3d-design-and-rendering-applications-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Animator's Guide to Elite 3D Design and Rendering Applications for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-social-media-uploading-on-twitter/"><u>2024 Approved Streamline Your Social Media Uploading on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/boosting-visuals-high-definition-on-twitter-vids-for-2024/"><u>Boosting Visuals High-Definition on Twitter Vids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-iphone-13-passcode-not-working-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Fix iPhone 13 Passcode not Working?

People and pages compete for more likes, followers, comments, etc. The competition is basically to engage a more significant audience, and people tend to use different tactics.</p><p>Previously when you shared videos online, the cover was the video’s starting. Still, with passing time and new options introduced, we have an option to add a thumbnail to our videos. A thumbnail is a cover photo that previews before the video is played.</p><p>In this article, you will be taught how to add a thumbnail to a Twitter video, change it and even enhance its looks.</p><h2 id="Add-Thumbnail-to-Twitter-Videos"><a href="#Add-Thumbnail-to-Twitter-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Add Thumbnail to Twitter Videos"></a>Add Thumbnail to Twitter Videos</h2><p>If you are a regular uploader on Twitter and want to engage a larger audience, you need to have some nice features for your posts.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4. The maximum video resolution on Twitter</strong></p><p>32 × 32 pixels is the minimum resolution.</p><p>1920 x 1200 pixels (maximum resolution) (and 1200 x 1900)</p><p><strong>5. The video aspect ratios on Twitter are limited</strong>.</p><p>For a better video ratio, the range should lie around: 1:2.39 - 2.39:1</p><p><strong>6.Video frame rate restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>The frame rate should not exceed 40 frames per second. While not behind the times, the app’s capabilities will continue to develop as digital technology advances.</p><p><strong>7. Video bitrate limit on Twitter</strong></p><p>Bitrate limit: 25 Mbps</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter"><a href="#Best-Video-Specifications-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Specifications for Twitter"></a>Best Video Specifications for Twitter</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Properties</th><th>Best Format Settings</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Resolution</strong></td><td>1280x720, 720x1280, 720x720</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Format</strong></td><td>MP4</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></td><td>16:9</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Frame Rate</strong></td><td>30 or 60 FPS</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Minimum)</strong></td><td>5000 kbps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bitrate (Maximum)</strong></td><td>128 kbps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With video consumption increasing year after year, Twitter video helps you to remain current and attract an audience that values video content for knowledge. Purchase intent rises by 34% when videos are shared on Twitter. In truth, Twitter is about far more than 280 characters: it’s about telling a narrative, your story.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-post-videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?"></a>Part 2. How to post videos on Twitter?</h2><p>Both Twitter In-feed videos and Twitter video advertising have comparable video specs, which is fortunate for you. However, we’ll still go through the Twitter video criteria for each of them, as well as some best practices for increasing interaction. It’s critical to understand the proper Twitter video specifications, such as the maximum size limit, format, and aspect ratios. By keeping an eye out for things like these, you can guarantee <strong>how to post videos on Twitter</strong> in the best possible form for a better watching experience.</p><ul><li>Never exceed a frame of 30 frames per second. Although Twitter can accept files with a frame rate of 40 frames per second, limiting your video to 30 frames per second will ensure cross-channel compatibility.</li></ul><h2 id="1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC"><a href="#1-Upload-Videos-on-Twitter-from-PC" class="headerlink" title="1.

Twitter is exploding with video, hence knowing the <strong>best video format for Twitter</strong> is imminent for users. Uploading videos is governed by a set of technical guidelines derived from the platform’s promise of sharing short-form material. According to studies, videos get more retweets than tweets that include photographs or GIFs. However, the rules for <strong>Twitter format videos</strong> are a little more stringent. If you want to upload a video to Twitter, ensure sure the video size, format, and associated video characteristics all fulfill the criteria listed above, otherwise the upload will fail. According to research, individuals who watch videos on Twitter are 50% more likely to be familiar with the business. Furthermore, <strong>uploading videos on Twitter iOS</strong> and Android is twice as remembered as those on other premium sites.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Best Video Formats for Twitter</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to post videos on Twitter?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-Video-Formats-for-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter"></a>Part 1. Best Video Formats for Twitter</h2><p>In the United States alone, Twitter has 67 million monthly active users. What makes it even more impressive? The majority of Twitter’s trending content is discovered organically, which means that users just navigate through their Twitter feeds to locate fascinating and shareable subjects right by <strong>uploading videos on Twitter</strong> from their cellphones. Nonetheless, Twitter has some impressive video statistics to boast about. There’s no denying that video outperforms all other types of online social media content.</p><p>Otherwise, you won’t be able to properly post movies to Twitter since they don’t fulfill the social media platform’s minimal standards. This is particularly true on Twitter, where your character count is already limited to 280. You can say and express so much more to your followers thanks to videos. Video tweets on Twitter get 10 times the amount of interaction as standard tweets.  Here are some 7 basic aspects you need to address.</p><p><strong>1. Twitter’s Best Video Format</strong></p><p>Twitter supports the MP4 format on the web. The Twitter video codecs MP4 and MOV are available on the mobile app.</p><p> <strong>There is a video duration restriction on Twitter</strong></p><p>Twitter has set a restriction of 2 minutes and 20 seconds for the maximum video duration. This comes to a total of 140 seconds, which is a reference to the days when Twitter had a character restriction of 140 characters.</p><p>If you’re using a basic account, you may submit films that are longer than 140 seconds, but you’ll have to trim them down to fit inside the restriction. That was the most you could go. However, when it comes to the perfect Twitter video duration, stick to 20 to 45 seconds. That seems to be the sweet spot, with Tweet videos of this length attracting the greatest attention.</p><p><strong>3. The maximum size of a video on Twitter</strong></p><p>You can submit movies up to 512MB in size, however, the maximum video duration on Twitter is 30 seconds. You may compress your video if it is greater than that.</p><p><strong>4.

Post Videos on Twitter from IOS App</h2><p>After testing the capability last month, Twitter has finally made it possible for Android and iOS users to post 4K videos. People will be able to share high-resolution photos on Twitter as a result of this. Fleets, Twitter’s counterpart of Instagram Stories that vanishes, now has a new function. You may now upload a photo or video from your phone’s gallery to a Fleet.

This isn’t to say that you won’t be able to complete the task. All you have to do now is be creative with the tools you do have. When making, modifying, and publishing videos to Twitter, whether on a smartphone or a computer, keep these <strong>best formats for Twitter videos</strong> in mind. They’re important for a pleasant user experience and the success of your profile. If all of the above seems like too much trouble, you can always hire someone to perform the task for you. There are plenty of firms that can make videos that get your brand recognized, in the right file format, and optimized to meet all of Twitter’s video requirements.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-tweeting-short-videos-to-interactive-shareable-customized-gifs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Tweeting Short Videos to Interactive, Shareable Customized GIFS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-how-to-upload-tiktok-videos-to-twitter/"><u>[New] How to Upload TikTok Videos to Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-utilizing-your-twitter-archive/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step Utilizing Your Twitter Archive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-channel-surge-strategy-using-youtube-outros-for-rapid-expansion-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Channel Surge Strategy Using YouTube Outros for Rapid Expansion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twitters-crown-jewels-the-most-liked-and-binge-watched-content/"><u>2024 Approved Twitter's Crown Jewels The Most Liked & Binge-Watched Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/download-free-online-mp4-to-mpeg-converter-easy-use-by-movavi/"><u>Download Free Online MP4 to MPEG Converter - Easy Use by Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-when-apple-account-locked-on-apple-iphone-11-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Fix when Apple Account Locked On Apple iPhone 11 Pro?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-accessing-and-making-sense-of-twitter-archives/"><u>In 2024, Accessing and Making Sense of Twitter Archives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-fingerprint-lock-apps-to-lock-your-honor-magic-5-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Fingerprint Lock Apps to Lock Your Honor Magic 5 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/mastery-over-taskbar-icon-separation-in-win-11/"><u>Mastery Over Taskbar Icon Separation in Win 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/new-driver-release-u-are-u-reader-v45-download-link/"><u>New Driver Release: U-Are-U Reader v4.5 Download Link</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/perfect-pairings-adding-songs-to-windows-11-videos-with-ease-for-2024/"><u>Perfect Pairings Adding Songs to Windows 11 Videos with Ease for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

PCs like this are commonly described as having adopted the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-raptor-lake-mobile-chips-get-soldered-to-micro-atx-motherboards" >MoDT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Mobile on Desktop) hybrid design.<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-touted-as-worlds-first-amd-advantage-mini-pc-packs-an-amd-r9-7945hx-and-rx-7600m-xt" >Mini PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/all-in-one-pcs" >All-in-Ones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were the first to make MoDT popular, but they also usually used mobile GPUs (or just integrated graphics). In contrast, Lenovo’s new Legion 7000K PC series, now<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1037096.html" >available in China <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , come in sizable tower cases and are sold with powerful Nvidia<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know" >GeForce RTX 40 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> series GPUs pre-installed.</p><p> With an MoDT platform, if you want to change your CPU you would have to buy a complete new mainboard &#x2F; CPU &#x2F; cooler bundle. Mobile CPUs aren’t socketed but are<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons" >soldered <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the board, so the average tech enthusiast isn’t going to be able to swap or upgrade the CPU. Thus it is very important to consider this spec very carefully before committing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiWmBjf3WBxdHs7uNFYu2U-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Looking more closely at the new Legion 7000K machines, we see that they come with a choice between two pretty strong Intel Raptor Lake Refresh mobile CPUs. The most powerful option is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unleashes-14th-gen-raptor-lake-refresh-hx-series-laptops-cpus-refreshed-chips-with-up-to-24-cores-58-ghz-boost-clock-and-192gb-ddr5-support" >Core i9-14900HX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with 24C&#x2F;32C, clock speeds up to 5.8 GHz, and 36MB Smart Cache. This powerful chip can be quite thrifty with its 55W base power, but also has a max turbo power of a laptop-melting 157W. In<a class="link"   href="https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks" >Geekbench <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nT rankings, for example, the performance of this CPU sits snugly between the Core i9-13900 and the Ryzen 9 PRO 7945 desktop chips – so it isn’t a lightweight.</p><p> One other CPU option is available to buyers, and that is the Core i7-14650HX. This is a 16C&#x2F;24T part, with clock speeds up to 5.2 GHz, and 30MB Smart Cache. Again there is a standard TDP of 55W, with the chip attempting to suck up to 157W if the situation demands it and cooling is adequate.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> As with other MoDT platforms, we aren’t sure if the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers,4181.html" >cooling system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy to change or upgrade, as the mounts won’t likely be the same as in a desktop PC. Lenovo seems to indicate its CPU cooler is good for up to 190W. If the CPU cooling fan is standard, we guess it could be changed or upgraded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHmtZBvJU6LcChAReYSDBU-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Another spec of the Legion 7000K gaming desktop that users will have to decide upon is what GPU to choose. The product page allows the choice of RTX 4060 &#x2F; Ti, RTX 4070 Ti &#x2F; Super. As with a traditional desktop PC, users can upgrade at any time later.</p><p> Lastly, the new Legion systems come with a standard 32GB DDR5-5600 dual-channel RAM and 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html" >PCIe Gen4 storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Again, upgrades shouldn’t be a problem in the future with SODIMMs presumably used for RAM, and two M.2 slots and two SATA ports available for storage.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> A wide range of I&#x2F;O is available from the motherboard including one USB 3.2 gen2 Type-C, a plethora of other USB Type A ports,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I&#x2F;O, 2.5G Ethernet (Wi-Fi 6 is also onboard), and DP video. The desktop GPU also has a trio of DP ports and an HDMI 2.1a output. Front I&#x2F;O consists of twin USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A ports and audio I&#x2F;O. The system also comes with Nahimic 5.1 sound and some<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-rgb-controls-native" >RGB lighting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lenovo is selling these Legion 7000K systems in China starting from around $1,300 (i7, RTX 4060), all the way up to around $2,350 (i9, RTX 4070 Ti Super). If those direct currency exchange figure prices were actual U.S. prices, these MoDT pre-builts wouldn’t really be very interesting. Customers should expect a decent discount to accept the CPU upgrade (and other) limitations.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-master-tweet-management-ultimate-list-of-unfollow-aids/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Master Tweet Management Ultimate List of Unfollow Aids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-best-free-vob-players-for-pc-and-mac/"><u>[New] Best Free VOB Players for PC and Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ensuring-accessibility-and-seo-with-responsive-design/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Ensuring Accessibility and SEO with Responsive Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-conversion-rates-with-twitter-ads-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Conversion Rates with Twitter Ads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2023-how-to-share-twitter-videos-on-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>2023 | How to Share Twitter Videos on WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-precision-rhythm-tracking-made-simple-try-these-free-ones/"><u>2024 Approved Precision Rhythm Tracking Made Simple - Try These Free Ones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-shorten-videos-for-instagram-a-mac-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Shorten Videos for Instagram A Mac Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/chatgpt-vs-google-translate-which-provides-superior-translation-accuracy/"><u>ChatGPT Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ultimate-List-5-Social-Networks-Like-Twitter"><a href="#Ultimate-List-5-Social-Networks-Like-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate List: 5 Social Networks Like Twitter"></a>Ultimate List: 5 Social Networks Like Twitter</h2><h1 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>At the start of the decade, Twitter was one of the fastest growing social networks. Eight years later, things seem as if they took the turn for the worse because the number of the platform’s monthly users is shrinking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-monthly-active-users.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In the last quarter of 2017, Twitter had only 330 million users, much less than Facebook that had 2,07 billion users or Instagram that had approximately 700 million users over that same period. Despite being easy to use and a powerful tool for reaching like-minded people or potential customers for your company’s products Twitter is slowly losing the reputation it once had.</p><h2 id="Why-Leave-Twitter"><a href="#Why-Leave-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Why Leave Twitter?"></a>Why Leave Twitter?</h2><p>At the end of the last year, the platform has increased the number of characters that can be used in a post, but this move did almost nothing to restore Twitter’s former glory. Celebrities getting caught up in Twitter wars, fake accounts and ultra-right-wing supporters have all contributed to the current state of affairs on Twitter. Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tumblr.com/" >Tumblr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.plurk.com/portal/" >Plurk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device. Although it doesn’t offer the same features as Twitter, Musical.ly is still an interesting alternative for this declining social network.</p><h4 id="4-Gab-ai"><a href="#4-Gab-ai" class="headerlink" title="4. Gab.ai"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://gab.ai/" >Gab.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Free speech supporters are going to love using Gab.ai, a social network that has had their mobile app banned from both Google Play and the App Store, for failing to comply with their policies on adult content. Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram. The social media platform supports sponsored content as well as ads, which makes it a perfect choice for everyone who wants to develop their business.</p><p>What is your favorite Twitter alternative?

But because of their size and modest thermal budgets, most mini PCs have two severe limitations: they rely on performance-limited mobile CPUs and they usually are stuck with integrated graphics.</p><p> Enter Mini Maker’s Turbo Mini X. This mini PC Is a mere 1.4 liters or 214.6 x 36.3 x 180mm, which is way smaller than even the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-mini-itx-pc-cases" >best mini ITX cases <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which usually are around 14 liters. Even an<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/asus-rog-nuc-has-a-dollar1629-starting-price" >ROG NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is much larger at 270 x 180 x 50 mm or 2.5 liters. Its 125W power brick is really tiny too.</p><p> And yet, despite its diminutive size, the Turbo Mini X can support a 65-watt desktop processor and uses a proprietary cable to connect to an external GPU so it can achieve higher speeds than if it had a standard Thunderbolt cable.</p><p> I had a chance to see the Turbo Mini X at Mini Maker’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex" >Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> booth and came away impressed with its design and potential performance. The Turbo Mini X comes with a tiny, non-standard B760 motherboard inside of its chassis. To get inside, you simply pop off the translucent side panel and you have access to the LGA 1700 socket, dual SODIMM slots and dual M.2 2280 SSD ports.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Lgg2ep6349kAWRyprQDe3-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Mini Maker Turbo Mini X Open"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> You can use any Raptor Lake or Raptor Lake Refresh chip that consumes 65 watts, a Core i5-1440 or Core i7-1470 for example. A passive heat sink covers the chip and a blower fan sits next to the sink and above the SODIMM slots. The kit doesn’t come with an SSD (or the RAM or CPU) but it does come with a heatsink you can use with your SSD to keep it cool.</p><p> When it comes out the Mini Maker will have versions that support DDR4 SODIMMs and others that support DDR5. There will be a SKU that has built-in Wi-Fi 7 and another that tops out at Wi-Fi 6E.</p><p> The Turbo Mini X is loaded with ports, including a 10 Gbps USB-C port that can output 45 watts for charging, a 20 Gbps USB-C port and 5 USB Type-A ports. But what’s most interesting is a proprietary port that connects to the Mini Maker StreamPlay X External Graphics Box, which is sold separately. The port uses USB-C, but according to Mini Maker, it enables a direct PCIe connection which is faster than what you get when using Thunderbolt 4 to connect a laptop to an after-market eGPU like the Razer Core X.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> A Mini Maker rep said that he saw a performance delta of just 5 percent between using the company’s PCIe connection to its graphics box and using a standard desktop PC with the same graphics card plugged directly into its motherboard. By comparison, he posited, a Thunderbolt eGPU could be 30 percent slower than a native GPU installation.</p><p> To connect to the StreamPlay X, you’ll need Mini Maker’s custom cable, which is about 40 cm (15 inches long). The cable we saw that Mini Maker’s booth had USB-C on both sides, making it look identical to any other USB-C cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PWKa2qagFoGCQJ7GH9t5H-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Mini Maker StreamPlay X Cable"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The StreamPlay X is a remarkably compact eGPU, but an attractive one. It allows you to see your card through a wrap-around plastic window and it has a case fan to help cool your graphics card. The device is available with different power supply capacities: 250, 350 or 400 watts.</p><p> At the upper end of this power envelope, you could probably run an RTX 4080. You’d probably need an adapter as there are two 8-pin connectors, but no 16-pin. The top, which has some air holes, easily pops off to allow you to install your card.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bofwgvfDKpeYqVAheTShC9-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Mini Maker StreamPlay X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> Mini Maker is a very new brand whose parent company is Hibertek, a Taiwanese OEM that builds B2B systems. Company reps said that they are trying to find a partner in the U.S. to sell the Turbo Mini X and its other mini PCs. The products may carry any future partners’ brand name or they could be labeled as Mini Maker. At present, the system is set to come out in mainland China and Taiwan.</p><p> Since the company is still organizing its release strategy, exact pricing isn’t available. However, a company rep said that the Turbo Mini X could cost $150 or less and so could the StreamPlay X, making the entire package just $300. That sounds unrealistically low and perhaps reflects wholesale pricing. These days, to get an eGPU by itself costs at least $300. It almost goes without saying that you’ll need to bring your own GPU, CPU, RAM and SSD.</p><p> But even at a much higher price, the Turbo Mini X and Streamplay X could be a very compelling combination. Users with limited desk space or those who just like the idea of a tiny desktop could get a lot of performance and flexibility with a very small footprint.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-7-must-try-iphone-vr-experiences-you-cant-miss/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Top 7 Must-Try iPhone VR Experiences You Can’t Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/"><u>[New] Hot Takes Highlight Twitter's Trending Topics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-time-saving-hacks-for-recording-instagram-stories/"><u>[New] In 2024, Time-Saving Hacks for Recording Instagram Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-saving-smiles-the-step-by-step-guide-to-downloading-tweets-animated-images-for-2024/"><u>[New] Saving Smiles The Step-by-Step Guide to Downloading Tweets’ Animated Images for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-comedy-kings-and-queens-whos-tops-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Comedy Kings and Queens Who's Tops, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-prime-video-hits-on-twitter-the-most-popular-watches-of-23/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Prime Video Hits on Twitter The Most Popular Watches of '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2023-quick-share-tweeted-videos-for-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>2023 Quick Share Tweeted Videos for WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-upload-media-to-twitter-without-copying-another-users-tweet/"><u>2024 Approved How To Upload Media to Twitter without Copying Another User's Tweet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transforming-google-meet-screens-on-devices/"><u>2024 Approved Transforming Google Meet Screens on Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/gratuit-nef-naar-jpeg-konverteren-direct-online-in-zeeland/"><u>Gratuit Nef-Naar-Jpeg-Konverteren - Direct Online in Zeeland</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-ispoofer-on-realme-gt-5-240w-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use iSpoofer on Realme GT 5 (240W)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/in-2024-an-android-enthusiasts-dream-customizing-your-phone-alerts-with-style-and-personality/"><u>In 2024, An Android Enthusiast’s Dream Customizing Your Phone Alerts with Style and Personality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-excellence-in-starting-points-for-panzoids/"><u>In 2024, Excellence in Starting Points for Panzoids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-integrate-insta-tweet-and-snap-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>In 2024, Integrate Insta, Tweet & Snap A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/master-iphone-image-conversion-from-jpgpng-to-pdf-for-2024/"><u>Master iPhone Image Conversion From JPG/PNG to PDF for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it. So, let us begin:</p><h2 id="Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos"><a href="#Why-Posting-Your-Own-Content-is-Better-than-Retweeting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos"></a>Why Posting Your Own Content is Better than Retweeting Videos</h2><p>If you are a blogger or an influencer, you will understand the importance of posting new content and engaging your Twitter followers. To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression. You can delve deeper and express yourself by posting your own content.</p><h3 id="A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile"><a href="#A-better-Look-for-your-Twitter-Profile" class="headerlink" title="A better Look for your Twitter Profile"></a>A better Look for your Twitter Profile</h3><p>Your own posts have a nicer look compared to retweets. On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time. If you are an individual on Twitter looking for new followers or creating your own unique identity, then retweeting other people’s tweets won’t cut it. You will have to post your own videos so people can find them on your profile.</p><h3 id="You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content"><a href="#You-are-not-Credited-for-the-Content" class="headerlink" title="You are not Credited for the Content"></a>You are not Credited for the Content</h3><p>If you are retweeting a post on your profile, you will mostly not appear in the data chain at all. And why that may be bad? If you retweet a video on your profile and someone retweets it again from your profile, the video will be linked back to the original source, taking you out of the equation. It will appear as if you didn’t exist at all.</p><p>Online profiles are all about creating an online presence, and what use is it if you are only part of someone else’s data, not creating your own.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-ReTweeting-Android" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without ReTweeting Android</h2><p>Those using Android may not have the Share Tweet feature that iPhones have. This feature allows you to share any Twitter video without retweeting. However, this is quite a nice hack that allows you to reap the same results. Here is how you can share a Twitter video without retweeting:</p><ul><li>Before starting, make sure the Twitter app is installed on your phone.</li><li>Open the Twitter app and locate the video you want to share.</li><li>Once you find the video, open the tweet and tap on the small <strong>share icon</strong>under the Tweet.</li><li>This will show you several options. Tap on <strong>Copy Link to Tweet.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-1.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now go back to the main page and type a new Tweet.</li><li>Compose your Tweet and then paste the URL that you copied.</li><li>Then you need to edit the URL that you pasted. Remove the parameters at the end that is “?s&#x3D;20”.</li><li>After removing, write in place of it “&#x2F;video&#x2F;1”.</li><li>For example if the URL is “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/" >https://twitter.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><username>&#x2F;status&#x2F;1234567890?s&#x3D;”</li><li>Then replace it with “<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1" >https://twitter.com/username/status/1234567890/video/1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-2.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><ul><li>Now click on the <strong>Tweet</strong>button to post your Tweet.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-share-video-on-twitter-without-retweeting-3.png"                      alt="twitter videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100533/7443" target="_top" id="2100533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>And that’s it! You can add any video to your tweet with this method. This method is for Android users only. You can also follow the same steps if you are using Chrome or Twitter on the web.</p><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-Without-Retweeting-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone"></a>Share Twitter Videos Without Retweeting iPhone</h2><p>There are various ways to post a video from Twitter without retweeting it. iPhone gives you the option to do that when you want to share the video.

However, retweeting is not what one may always want. Sometimes constantly retweeting can create clutter on your profile.</p><p>Retweets also don’t allow you to change captions or give the post a bit of your flavor. In that case, you might want to add your thoughts on a particular Twitter video or express something entirely different. This article will show you you can post or Tweet the same video without retweeting it.

To ensure you have original content, 75% of your posts should be yours, and 25% should be retweets. Here is why you need original content for your Twitter profile:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1"><a href="#Build-a-Relationship-with-the-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="Build a Relationship with the Audience"></a>Build a Relationship with the Audience</h3><p>Content is vital in building relationships across the globe. Your signature or original content allows people to associate a specific type of content with you. It can be because of your views on a matter or what you represent. Constantly retweeting content might leave a negative impression on your audience, especially about your originality.</p><h3 id="Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1"><a href="#Your-own-Input-to-a-Situation-1" class="headerlink" title="Your own Input to a Situation"></a>Your own Input to a Situation</h3><p>While retweeting allows you to leave a comment on someone else’s tweet, sometimes posting a video yourself and writing your thoughts on it creates a better impression.

On your profile, people will find your views more interesting if they see you have posted it yourself and not just retweeted different videos.</p><p>Usually, the person who retweets is almost hidden in the retweet. So, people hardly notice who retweeted it, so it doesn’t look good. On the flip side, if you post content and someone retweets it, you will gain new followers as people connect with your content and want to explore more of it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130528/26400" target="_top" id="2130528">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130528" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130528/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Market-your-Own-Brand-1"><a href="#Market-your-Own-Brand-1" class="headerlink" title="Market your Own Brand"></a>Market your Own Brand</h3><p>When you are retweeting posts and videos, you are marketing someone else on your profile most of the time.
