People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom.

It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Twitter-Marketing-101-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Twitter-Marketing-101-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Twitter Marketing 101: Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Twitter Marketing 101: Step-by-Step Guide</h2><h1 id="How-to-Advertise-on-Twitter"><a href="#How-to-Advertise-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="How to Advertise on Twitter"></a>How to Advertise on Twitter</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> A few years after Twitter was launched, the Twitter Ads platform went live. Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see campaign objectives, select the ones that are most appropriate for your campaign and then click on Create Campaign button. This action will open a new window where you can give a title to your campaign or decide when you want the campaign to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 2"                ></p><p> In the next step, you will be asked to define your target audience. The platform offers a wide array of targeting options including gender, postal code or language. Twitter Ads offers support through the process, so you can maximize efficiency and reduce the costs of the campaign.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 3"                ></p><p> Once you’ve defined the target audience as precisely as possible, you can move on to set your budget. By setting the financial limit to your campaign you can control how much you are spending on ads on a daily basis.</p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-4.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 4"                ></p><p> At the end of the ad campaign setup, you will be asked to select a tweet you want to promote. The platform provides a list of tweets that already exist, but you can also insert the tweet your marketing team has created. You can also upload media, before hitting the Publish Tweet button and starting your new Twitter Ad campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-twitter-promotions-essential-tips/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Twitter Promotions  Essential Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-social-sensation-tweets-whats-going-big-online/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Social Sensation Tweets  What's Going Big Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-trending-tweets-triumph-todays-top-viewed-videos/"><u>[Updated] Trending Tweets Triumph  Today's Top Viewed Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-end-audio-blackout-vocalize-tweet-videos/"><u>[New] End Audio Blackout  Vocalize Tweet Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tweet-to-whatsapp-video-dissemination-methods/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Tweet-to-WhatsApp Video Dissemination Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/twitters-new-era-of-videography-aspect-ratios-mandatory-for-2024/"><u>Twitter's New Era of Videography  Aspect Ratios Mandatory for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-definitive-handbook-to-reacting-on-youtube-tweets-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Definitive Handbook to Reacting on YouTube Tweets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-eye-catching-tweets-of-the-year-top-view-counts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Eye-Catching Tweets of the Year  Top View Counts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-syncing-twitter-to-snapchat-video-uploading-techniques/"><u>[New] Syncing Twitter to Snapchat  Video Uploading Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-full-hd-magic-for-your-twitter-vidz/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking Full HD Magic for Your Twitter Vidz</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-photomontage-effect-visual-synthesis-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Photomontage Effect  Visual Synthesis Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-google-play-location-on-vivo-v27e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Google Play Location On Vivo V27e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-storage-deals-cloud-pricing-of-future-year/"><u>In 2024, Best Storage Deals  Cloud Pricing of Future Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/low-cost-high-quality-4k-capture-devices/"><u>Low-Cost, High-Quality 4K Capture Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-audio-experience-top-5-voice-recorder-software-for-phones-and-tablets/"><u>Updated Elevate Your Audio Experience Top 5 Voice Recorder Software for Phones and Tablets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/asus-rog-phone-7-bootloop-problem-how-to-fix-it-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Asus ROG Phone 7 Bootloop Problem, How to Fix it Without Data Loss | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-beat-making-brilliance-music-for-your-instareals/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Beat-Making Brilliance  Music for Your InstaReals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/sonic-palette-an-intensive-look-at-avs-editors-features-user-reviews-and-alternate-choices-in-audio-editing-for-2024/"><u>Sonic Palette An Intensive Look at AVS Editors Features, User Reviews, and Alternate Choices in Audio Editing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-exit-android-factory-mode-on-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Itel P55? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/apple-iphone-se-2022-asking-for-passcode-after-ios-1714-update-what-to-do-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple iPhone SE (2022) Asking for Passcode after iOS 17/14 Update, What to Do? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Videos are one of the most engaging and eye-catching sources of information. Human nature prefers an easy and convenient way to get the required information such as videos instead of reading an entire article or post. Unfortunately, there is a common problem of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome for most Twitter users. There can so many distinct reasons that might be causing such a problem. If you are the one who is facing the issue of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, then this article is for you. By following the methods discussed in this article, the videos will start to auto-play while you scroll through the Twitter Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gif-from-twitter.gif"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There could be so many reasons for Twitter videos not playing in Chrome.

Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn’t have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Flash-for-Twitter"><a href="#Flash-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Flash for Twitter"></a>Flash for Twitter</h4></li></ol><p>If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter.

Click the drop-down in front of flash and select ‘Allow’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix3"                ></p><p>This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime.

The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-tweeting-visual-stories-from-vids-to-interactive-gifs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Tweeting Visual Stories  From Vids to Interactive GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-go-live-on-twitter-a-practical-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Go Live on Twitter  A Practical Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-navigating-twitters-algorithm-to-amplify-your-message/"><u>[New] In 2024, Navigating Twitter's Algorithm to Amplify Your Message</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2023s-top-tweets-the-highest-traffic-watchlist-for-2024/"><u>2023'S Top Tweets  The Highest Traffic Watchlist for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-live-and-learn-twitter-video-chronicles-of-23/"><u>In 2024, Live and Learn  Twitter Video Chronicles of '23</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-tiktok-dominance-on-twitter-the-top-share-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, TikTok Dominance on Twitter  The Top Share List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-strategic-use-of-twitters-wayback-machine-features/"><u>[New] Strategic Use of Twitter's Wayback Machine Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-real-time-tips-to-dominate-twitter-broadcasts/"><u>In 2024, Real-Time Tips to Dominate Twitter Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-how-to-locate-your-youtube-fanbase-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Locate Your YouTube Fanbase for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/video-sharing-warriors-which-fights-better-obs-or-twitch-studio-for-2024/"><u>Video Sharing Warriors  Which Fights Better - OBS or Twitch Studio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-top-10plus-instagram-content-downloaders-reviewed/"><u>[New] Top 10+ Instagram Content Downloaders Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-maximizing-your-youtube-earnings-with-smart-tactics/"><u>2024 Approved  Maximizing Your YouTube Earnings with Smart Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-pro-video-gear-expert-recommendations-for-youtube-clips/"><u>2024 Approved  Pro Video Gear  Expert Recommendations for YouTube Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/n-2024-audio-overhaul-methods-for-content-creators-online/"><u>[New] In 2024, Audio Overhaul Methods for Content Creators Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-aerial-visual-flux-free-lutts-for-dji-drones-then-pay-upgrade/"><u>[New] Aerial Visual Flux  Free LUTTs for DJI Drones, Then Pay Upgrade</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-mastering-discords-video-communication-for-pcios-users-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Discord's Video Communication for PC/iOS Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-should-you-pay-for-unlimited-youtube-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Should You Pay for Unlimited YouTube, In 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager. On the left side of the screen, you’ll be able to see campaign objectives, select the ones that are most appropriate for your campaign and then click on Create Campaign button. This action will open a new window where you can give a title to your campaign or decide when you want the campaign to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 2"                ></p><p> In the next step, you will be asked to define your target audience. The platform offers a wide array of targeting options including gender, postal code or language. Twitter Ads offers support through the process, so you can maximize efficiency and reduce the costs of the campaign.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 3"                ></p><p> Once you’ve defined the target audience as precisely as possible, you can move on to set your budget.

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Premier-Alternatives-Exceeding-the-Limits-of-Twitter"><a href="#Premier-Alternatives-Exceeding-the-Limits-of-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Premier Alternatives Exceeding the Limits of Twitter"></a>Premier Alternatives Exceeding the Limits of Twitter</h2><h1 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Ollie-Mattison"><a href="#Ollie-Mattison" class="headerlink" title="Ollie Mattison"></a>Ollie Mattison</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>At the start of the decade, Twitter was one of the fastest growing social networks. Eight years later, things seem as if they took the turn for the worse because the number of the platform’s monthly users is shrinking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-monthly-active-users.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In the last quarter of 2017, Twitter had only 330 million users, much less than Facebook that had 2,07 billion users or Instagram that had approximately 700 million users over that same period. Despite being easy to use and a powerful tool for reaching like-minded people or potential customers for your company’s products Twitter is slowly losing the reputation it once had.</p><h2 id="Why-Leave-Twitter"><a href="#Why-Leave-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Why Leave Twitter?"></a>Why Leave Twitter?</h2><p>At the end of the last year, the platform has increased the number of characters that can be used in a post, but this move did almost nothing to restore Twitter’s former glory. Celebrities getting caught up in Twitter wars, fake accounts and ultra-right-wing supporters have all contributed to the current state of affairs on Twitter. Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. Tumblr</h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. Plurk</h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device. Although it doesn’t offer the same features as Twitter, Musical.ly is still an interesting alternative for this declining social network.</p><h4 id="4-Gab-ai"><a href="#4-Gab-ai" class="headerlink" title="4. Gab.ai"></a>4. Gab.ai</h4><p>Free speech supporters are going to love using Gab.ai, a social network that has had their mobile app banned from both Google Play and the App Store, for failing to comply with their policies on adult content. Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. Instagram</h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram. The social media platform supports sponsored content as well as ads, which makes it a perfect choice for everyone who wants to develop their business.</p><p>What is your favorite Twitter alternative?

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite-3"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite-3" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-3"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga.

That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to.

BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2.

Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4.

Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot.

Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation.

The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-2"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-2"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-2" class="headerlink" title="2.
