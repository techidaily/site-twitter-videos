Yes, you guessed it right, that messaging application is WhatsApp.</p><p>Below are the steps you can follow if you want to send a Twitter video via WhatsApp using the link.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-6"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter-6" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Log in to your Twitter account using your credentials if you are not already logged in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-twitter-videos-whatsapp-1.jpg"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share-3"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the video and tap share"></a>Step 2: Find the video and tap share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1.

Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2.

Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone?), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134493/18498" target="_top" id="2134493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134493/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-acquire-high-quality-sounds-for-media-creators/"><u>[New] Acquire High-Quality Sounds for Media Creators!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-chart-your-course-to-youtube-success-with-these-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Chart Your Course to YouTube Success with These Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/a-music-lovers-guide-to-the-best-places-for-complimentary-tunes-online-top-picks/"><u>A Music Lover's Guide to the Best Places for Complimentary Tunes Online (Top Picks)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/advancements-from-pci-sig-new-copperlink-cable-solutions-set-to-revolutionize-pcie-5-and-6-connections-keep-an-eye-out-for-the-upcoming-pcie-7-standard/"><u>Advancements From PCI-SIG: New CopperLink Cable Solutions Set to Revolutionize PCIe 5 and #6 Connections; Keep an Eye Out for the Upcoming PCIe 7 Standard</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/1723262349631-ayaneo-unveils-the-newly-launched-amd-driven-mini-pc-the-classic-macintosh-revival-now-in-retail/"><u>Ayaneo Unveils the Newly Launched AMD-Driven Mini PC: The Classic Macintosh Revival - Now in Retail!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/dive-into-electronics-with-toms-gadget-guide-professional-reviews-and-comparisons/"><u>Dive Into Electronics with Tom's Gadget Guide - Professional Reviews and Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/expert-tips-and-guides-on-electronics-from-toms-hardware-hub/"><u>Expert Tips and Guides on Electronics From Tom's Hardware Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/1722889258490-fix-the-missing-d3dx925dll-issue-on-your-pc-easily/"><u>Fix the Missing d3dx9_25.dll Issue on Your PC Easily</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-meizu-21-pro-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Meizu 21 Pro Bypass FRP Tools for PC That Actually Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-unleash-creativity-with-gopros-time-lapse-technology/"><u>In 2024, Unleash Creativity with GoPro's Time-Lapse Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/unveiling-gadget-secrets-with-toms-hardware-analysis/"><u>Unveiling Gadget Secrets with Tom's Hardware Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/update-your-lenovo-drivers-on-windows-1n-get-the-latest-versions-now/"><u>Update Your Lenovo Drivers on Windows 1N - Get the Latest Versions Now</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don’t post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfollow-apps-twitter.jpg"                      alt="unfollow apps"                ></p><p>If you are having a tough time deciding which <strong>unfollow apps</strong> you should use, you are at the right place because in this article we are going to present top seven options that are currently available at the market.</p><p>Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.</p><h2 id="7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter"><a href="#7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter"></a>7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter</h2><p>Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.</p><h4 id="1-SocialOopmph"><a href="#1-SocialOopmph" class="headerlink" title="1.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable"><a href="#●-Be-relatable" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body"><a href="#●-Use-your-body" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects"><a href="#●-Use-effects" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-3"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-3" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously.

So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions.

A lot of times, making a reaction video and sharing thoughts while watching something is just boring. However, there are some tips and tricks you can use to make your reaction videos more interesting and even hilarious!</p><h3 id="●-The-tone-is-everything-3"><a href="#●-The-tone-is-everything-3" class="headerlink" title="● The tone is everything"></a>● The tone is everything</h3><p>Good reaction videos are fun and positive. Excitement is king here, so don’t be afraid to ham it up a bit. Think about the most excited you’ve ever been in your life — meeting the love of your life, watching a baby take its first steps, scoring tickets to your favorite band’s concert — and channel that excitement into your reaction video.</p><p>People like watching other people get excited because it reminds them of how much fun life can be.</p><h3 id="●-Be-relatable-3"><a href="#●-Be-relatable-3" class="headerlink" title="● Be relatable"></a>● Be relatable</h3><p>Make sure you’re relatable to the type of audience who’s most likely to watch the video. For example, if you want to appeal to a younger demographic, then you should use more current slang in your videos. Similarly, if the audience is likely to be grown-up adults, then talk accordingly so your reaction video is relatable and appealing to them.</p><h3 id="●-Keep-things-fun-3"><a href="#●-Keep-things-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="● Keep things fun"></a>● Keep things fun</h3><p>A common mistake people make when recording videos is taking themselves too seriously. By using jokes and humor, not only will viewers be entertained by the video itself, but they may also be more inclined to share it with their friends and family!</p><h3 id="●-Use-your-body-3"><a href="#●-Use-your-body-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use your body"></a>● Use your body</h3><p>Eye contact is extremely important when it comes to communicating with other people, but most importantly, it’s necessary for keeping your viewer focused on the screen. If you’re looking at your notes or fumbling with your phone, it’s likely that your viewer will start looking at something else as well. So take advantage of this fact by doing something silly or memorable while narrating your video. It makes for good entertainment and helps keep viewers engaged.</p><h3 id="●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3"><a href="#●-Shoot-with-clear-background-3" class="headerlink" title="● Shoot with clear background"></a>● Shoot with clear background</h3><p>Make sure your background is clear and that your camera is placed in a location where there will be minimal disruptions. The last thing you want is for someone else to sneak into your frame and ruin the quality of your video.</p><h3 id="●-Avoid-background-music-3"><a href="#●-Avoid-background-music-3" class="headerlink" title="● Avoid background music"></a>● Avoid background music</h3><p>Tip: Try not to use any type of music in the background of your video. This can distract from the main focus of the video, which is supposed to be your reaction.</p><h3 id="●-Use-effects-3"><a href="#●-Use-effects-3" class="headerlink" title="● Use effects"></a>● Use effects</h3><p>Try using special effects in your video. Some editing programs include features that allow you to add special effects and transitions into your video, which can help improve the look and feel of your video after it has been uploaded onto YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/twitter-reaction-videos-5.png"                      alt="numerous effects in Filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115945/19272" target="_top" id="2115945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115945/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Considering the popularity of TikTok reaction videos, Twitter reaction videos are expected to follow the trend.</p><p>For certain occasions, these videos are the perfect outlet to express your emotions and give viewers some insight into what you think about the particular Tweet. You could get the same results using a normal video, or even screenshots of your life. But adding the right type of music and visuals to your reaction video are what can make a difference between someone watching and loving it, or rolling their eyes and hitting skip.

PCs like this are commonly described as having adopted the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-raptor-lake-mobile-chips-get-soldered-to-micro-atx-motherboards" >MoDT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Mobile on Desktop) hybrid design.<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-touted-as-worlds-first-amd-advantage-mini-pc-packs-an-amd-r9-7945hx-and-rx-7600m-xt" >Mini PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/all-in-one-pcs" >All-in-Ones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> were the first to make MoDT popular, but they also usually used mobile GPUs (or just integrated graphics). In contrast, Lenovo’s new Legion 7000K PC series, now<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1037096.html" >available in China <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , come in sizable tower cases and are sold with powerful Nvidia<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/nvidia-ada-lovelace-and-geforce-rtx-40-series-everything-we-know" >GeForce RTX 40 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> series GPUs pre-installed.</p><p> With an MoDT platform, if you want to change your CPU you would have to buy a complete new mainboard &#x2F; CPU &#x2F; cooler bundle. Mobile CPUs aren’t socketed but are<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-soldering-irons" >soldered <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the board, so the average tech enthusiast isn’t going to be able to swap or upgrade the CPU. Thus it is very important to consider this spec very carefully before committing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiWmBjf3WBxdHs7uNFYu2U-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Looking more closely at the new Legion 7000K machines, we see that they come with a choice between two pretty strong Intel Raptor Lake Refresh mobile CPUs. The most powerful option is the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unleashes-14th-gen-raptor-lake-refresh-hx-series-laptops-cpus-refreshed-chips-with-up-to-24-cores-58-ghz-boost-clock-and-192gb-ddr5-support" >Core i9-14900HX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , with 24C&#x2F;32C, clock speeds up to 5.8 GHz, and 36MB Smart Cache. This powerful chip can be quite thrifty with its 55W base power, but also has a max turbo power of a laptop-melting 157W. In<a class="link"   href="https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks" >Geekbench <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> nT rankings, for example, the performance of this CPU sits snugly between the Core i9-13900 and the Ryzen 9 PRO 7945 desktop chips – so it isn’t a lightweight.</p><p> One other CPU option is available to buyers, and that is the Core i7-14650HX. This is a 16C&#x2F;24T part, with clock speeds up to 5.2 GHz, and 30MB Smart Cache. Again there is a standard TDP of 55W, with the chip attempting to suck up to 157W if the situation demands it and cooling is adequate.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> As with other MoDT platforms, we aren’t sure if the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpu-coolers,4181.html" >cooling system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is easy to change or upgrade, as the mounts won’t likely be the same as in a desktop PC. Lenovo seems to indicate its CPU cooler is good for up to 190W. If the CPU cooling fan is standard, we guess it could be changed or upgraded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHmtZBvJU6LcChAReYSDBU-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Lenovo Legion 7000K gaming PCs"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Lenovo)</p><p> Another spec of the Legion 7000K gaming desktop that users will have to decide upon is what GPU to choose. The product page allows the choice of RTX 4060 &#x2F; Ti, RTX 4070 Ti &#x2F; Super. As with a traditional desktop PC, users can upgrade at any time later.</p><p> Lastly, the new Legion systems come with a standard 32GB DDR5-5600 dual-channel RAM and 1TB<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ssds,3891.html" >PCIe Gen4 storage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Again, upgrades shouldn’t be a problem in the future with SODIMMs presumably used for RAM, and two M.2 slots and two SATA ports available for storage.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> A wide range of I&#x2F;O is available from the motherboard including one USB 3.2 gen2 Type-C, a plethora of other USB Type A ports,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> I&#x2F;O, 2.5G Ethernet (Wi-Fi 6 is also onboard), and DP video. The desktop GPU also has a trio of DP ports and an HDMI 2.1a output. Front I&#x2F;O consists of twin USB 3.2 Gen1 Type-A ports and audio I&#x2F;O. The system also comes with Nahimic 5.1 sound and some<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-rgb-controls-native" >RGB lighting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Lenovo is selling these Legion 7000K systems in China starting from around $1,300 (i7, RTX 4060), all the way up to around $2,350 (i9, RTX 4070 Ti Super). If those direct currency exchange figure prices were actual U.S. prices, these MoDT pre-builts wouldn’t really be very interesting. Customers should expect a decent discount to accept the CPU upgrade (and other) limitations.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-20-anime-song-opens-in-ranking/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Best 20 Anime Song Opens in Ranking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hidden-viewers-guide-reading-instagram-stories-privately-from-pcandroidios/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Hidden Viewers Guide Reading Instagram Stories Privately From PC/Android/iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-your-favorite-top-10-youtube-and-facebooks-music-gems-for-2024/"><u>[New] Your Favorite Top 10 YouTube & Facebook's Music Gems for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-end-of-acid-pro-top-software-alternatives-reviewed/"><u>2024 Approved The End of ACID Pro Top Software Alternatives Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/amazon-fire-or-ipad-a-comprehensive-guide-to-selecting-yours/"><u>Amazon Fire or iPad: A Comprehensive Guide to Selecting Yours</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-use-vpna-to-fake-gps-location-on-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Complete Tutorial to Use VPNa to Fake GPS Location On Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/easiest-guide-how-to-clone-poco-x6-pro-phone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>Easiest Guide How to Clone Poco X6 Pro Phone? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/experience-ultimate-gaming-at-169-a-month-premium-nzxt-pcs-with-rtx-4070-ti-and-intel-i7-up-for-grabs/"><u>Experience Ultimate Gaming at $169 a Month – Premium NZXT PCs with RTX 4070 Ti and Intel I7 Up for Grabs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/exploring-the-high-power-value-proposition-of-ibuypowers-bespoke-gaming-pcs-a-detailed-analysis/"><u>Exploring the High-Power, Value Proposition of iBuyPower’s Bespoke Gaming PCs – A Detailed Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-synthesize-and-add-videos-to-your-listing/"><u>In 2024, Synthesize and Add Videos to Your Listing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/inside-toms-electronics-hub-what-you-need-to-know/"><u>Inside Tom's Electronics Hub: What You Need To Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-crop-like-a-pro-a-step-by-step-fcpx-guide-for-2024/"><u>New Crop Like a Pro A Step-by-Step FCPX Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/next-level-performance-awaits-in-the-dell-alienware-aurora-r9-an-in-depth-look-at-tomorrows-gaming-pc/"><u>Next-Level Performance Awaits in the Dell Alienware Aurora R9: An In-Depth Look at Tomorrow's Gaming PC</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135374/19272" target="_top" id="2135374">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135374" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135374/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

You may have assumed it is simply due to the popularity of the service. And while that is part of the reason, there is more to the story. There is a <strong>Periscope Twitter</strong> relationship, which is why you often see Periscope links showing up on your feed. If you want to set up a Twitter live stream, you can use Periscope to get it done.</p><p> Do you know the relationship between Twitter and Periscope? Do you know how to <strong>live stream on Twitter</strong>? In this article, we will help you solve that puzzle.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: Does Twitter Own Periscope?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: Q&amp;A on Twitter Live Streaming and Periscope</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Does-Twitter-Own-Periscope"><a href="#Part-1-Does-Twitter-Own-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Does Twitter Own Periscope?"></a>Part 1: Does Twitter Own Periscope?</h2><p> Yes, Twitter acquired Periscope in January 2015. The acquisition is a major reason why we see so many Periscope videos on Twitter feeds. The company wants to ensure that both services are integrated to the benefit of users who want to broadcast or watch this type of live content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-twitter.JPG"                      alt="periscope twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-Twitter-and-Periscope-Work-Together"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-Twitter-and-Periscope-Work-Together" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?"></a>Part 2: How Do Twitter and Periscope Work Together?</h2><p> If you are hoping to start a live streaming video broadcast, you can get the process rolling within your Twitter app. On both Android and iOS devices, you may go to the compose tweet button, and then select the icon that looks like a video record notification.</p><p> An interesting aspect of the Periscope Twitter integration is that when you start a live video on Twitter, it is accessible on both platforms. People who are on Twitter and wanting to see live videos can search for your video. And the same is true on the Periscope app and website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-twitter-work.JPG"                      alt="periscope twitter work together"                ></p><p> Alternatively, you could start your live video on the Periscope app. It is entirely your choice. But we find that most users would rather do this through Twitter, especially if that is the social media app you are usually accessing for posts or consuming content.</p><p> It is possible to share your past broadcasts as a tweet, direct message or by copying the link and sending it to someone’s email address.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Q-A-on-Twitter-Live-Streaming-and-Periscope"><a href="#Part-3-Q-A-on-Twitter-Live-Streaming-and-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Q&amp;A on Twitter Live Streaming and Periscope"></a>Part 3: Q&amp;A on Twitter Live Streaming and Periscope</h2><h4 id="1-How-Can-I-Tweet-Out-My-Broadcast"><a href="#1-How-Can-I-Tweet-Out-My-Broadcast" class="headerlink" title="1. How Can I Tweet Out My Broadcast?"></a>1. How Can I Tweet Out My Broadcast?</h4><p> You have just started your broadcast through the Twitter app, and you want to share it as a tweet on peoples’ timelines. All you need to do is press the “share live” button, and you are all set. You can send it out as a tweet, direct message or as a link. The same applies to videos that are complete, as they save automatically on the cloud.</p><h4 id="2-Can-I-Open-Periscope-Videos-through-Twitter"><a href="#2-Can-I-Open-Periscope-Videos-through-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="2. Can I Open Periscope Videos through Twitter?"></a>2. Can I Open Periscope Videos through Twitter?</h4><p> Yes, if you are hoping to watch a live video in Periscope, you can open it through the Twitter app. When you find the video, swipe to open the options menu. It will allow you to open the video in Periscope. You must swipe right if you are on the iOS platform, and swipe up on Android devices.</p><h4 id="3-What-Are-Periscope-Live-360-Videos"><a href="#3-What-Are-Periscope-Live-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. What Are Periscope Live 360 Videos?"></a>3. What Are Periscope Live 360 Videos?</h4><p> Live 360 videos are captured using special devices or cameras, where you get an entire 360 degree view of the stream. If you are using a device that has VR capability, such as Samsung smartphones, you can view the 360 degree video through your Gear VR headset. It is also watchable with Google Cardboard.</p><p> If you are using a regular smartphone and you do not have a VR headset, you can simply use your fingers to move around the 360 degree video to access different viewpoints. Creating 360 degree videos is a different matter, as the feature is only available to select partners through Periscope.</p><h4 id="4-Can-I-Block-Live-Streaming-Viewers-Through-Twitter"><a href="#4-Can-I-Block-Live-Streaming-Viewers-Through-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="4. Can I Block Live Streaming Viewers Through Twitter?"></a>4. Can I Block Live Streaming Viewers Through Twitter?</h4><p> If you do not appreciate certain users watching your live videos, or you are unhappy with the comments they are posting, you may block them through the app. Simply click on their comment, go onto their profile, and use the regular means of blocking the person. That user will be unable to watch or comment on your videos, or access anything related to your profile. They cannot see any of your tweets either.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136624/26400" target="_top" id="2136624">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136624" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136624/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Concluison"><a href="#Concluison" class="headerlink" title="Concluison"></a>Concluison</h2><p> The Twitter live stream feature is designed with users in mind.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR sound card was a great card in 2013. In 2019, however, the ZxR has started to lag behind the competition. It provides pretty clear audio, but it requires two PCIe slots and costs $250 MSRP. Compare this to products from other audio card manufacturers, such as ASUS and EVGA, which been able to provide better audio performance for as little as $160. That said, the Sound Blaster ZxR isn’t without merits: it has a lot of inputs and outputs, extensive EQ software, and still produces quality sound. It also has features gamers need, such as treble boost and voice isolation, and it accommodates 6.3mm auxiliary input and output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/U_vmwZDe5HbbungQ5L2hzf2LVto=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-4-b0d1cca56ec04a61b83e20d1cecf2aea.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Design-Sleek-and-convenient"><a href="#Design-Sleek-and-convenient" class="headerlink" title="Design: Sleek and convenient"></a><strong>Design: Sleek and convenient</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR features a black and red chassis on its main and daughter boards, brightly accented in gold around the transistors and back plate. Together, the cards have enough outputs to natively support a 5.1 surround sound speaker system. They have 2 RCA outputs, 2 3.5mm outputs, two RCA inputs, one optical TOSLINK input, one optical TOSLINK output, one 6.3mm microphone input, and one 6.3 headphone output jack. The ZxR also comes with an Audio Control Module (ACM), which is Creative Labs’ take on an amplifier and on extending the 6.3mm connections. It has both 3.5mm and 6.3mm inputs and outputs so you can choose where you’d like to plug in your headphones and microphone. On the ACM’s face lies a big, plastic volume knob that controls the headphones’ loudness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115945/19272" target="_top" id="2115945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115945/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hardware-Some-odd-decisions"><a href="#Hardware-Some-odd-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Hardware: Some odd decisions"></a><strong>Hardware: Some odd decisions</strong></h2><p> For users who may own higher impedance headphones, the amplifier can comfortably drive headphones with up to a 600 ohm impedance. Unfortunately, the volume control on the ACM works passively by altering the output impedance, which can distort audio on headphones with high inductance like the Sennheiser HD800 (see “<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-output-impedance-4690092" >How Low Should Output Impedance Be? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ”). A better and only slightly more costly solution for Creative Labs would have been to have the knob control the ZxR’s in-built volume control rather than try to do it passively. The HD800 sounded fine when plugged directly into the sound card and using the system volume control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1t84P8oe4qch2aJ6lknx0lwunWw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-2-de43d07bd3db40a282f55347c8956c9a.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup"><a href="#Setup-Process-Installation-Easy-install-irritating-setup" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup"></a><strong>Setup Process&#x2F;Installation: Easy install, irritating setup</strong></h2><p> To install the hardware, we popped open our mid-size PC tower and inserted the sound card and daughter board into two available PCIe slots. Creative Labs had the foresight to build the main card with a PCIe 1x slots, giving the user flexibility in where they connect their cards to the motherboard. Once the cards were secured, we plugged the headphones and microphone into the corresponding jacks.</p><p> It’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP.</p><p> Unfortunately, configuring Creative Labs’ drivers and software suite was a much less intuitive process. The ZxR’s outputs are controlled via the Sound Blaster Z-series Software, where users can select whether they’re listening with their headphones or their speakers, apply EQ effects, and more. By default, the software is set to output to speakers with several different EQ effects turned on. We had to manually switch it to headphone output and turn off EQ; the software does not automatically detect which jacks are in use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/6uorHzKoJdW1FBv0B5ZfeoE8XzU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-3-17de2156e4294b5c85f151bd0cd97aa4.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><h2 id="Audio-Excellent-sound"><a href="#Audio-Excellent-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Excellent sound"></a><strong>Audio: Excellent sound</strong></h2><p> Once the EQ effects are turned off, the Sound Blaster ZxR provides beautiful sound. While it wasn’t quite as clean or crisp as an enthusiast audiophile amplifier, such as the OPPO HA-1, it was solid for a system that costs a quarter of the HA-1’s price. On the HD-800s, the bass came across slightly muddy, but the ZxR provides solid quality for consumer-grade headphones like the Sennheiser GSP300 or the Sony MDR-7506. As our our<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/headphones-buying-guide-4172763" >headphone buying guide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suggests, most headphones under $250 will not be sensitive enough to meaningfully distinguish between the ZxR and the HA-1.</p><p> Should you happen to own dynamic headphones, you should find their impedance curve. Dynamic headphones with a high impedance may be distorted by the ACM, thanks to the ACM’s high resistance. How your headphones will be affected depends on their impedance curve: for the HD800s, for example, there is a peak at 100Hz (this range captures electric bass and the lower octaves of guitars), so the upper bass range is boosted relative to the other frequencies in the audio. Increasing the volume on the ACM reduces its output resistance and in turn reduces the distortion, but it may be easier to plug equipment directly into the sound card and use the system volume instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1CZw4BSxxTqlBF1kxT0_rl73XCU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW833111-5-e1022e9adc854517af98407c4be32691.jpg"                      alt="Sound Blaster ZxR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Ramirez</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137215/26400" target="_top" id="2137215">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137215" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137215/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility"><a href="#Software-Lots-of-options-with-mixed-utility" class="headerlink" title="Software: Lots of options with mixed utility"></a><strong>Software: Lots of options with mixed utility</strong></h2><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package. Here, you can EQ any frequency between 20 and 20,000 Hz or activate “Crystallization,” “Scout Mode,” and “Theater Mode.” Crystallization adds punch to the audio’s treble, making voices stand out against the background. Theater Mode is similar to Crystallization, but it tries to_only_ boost voices instead of the entire treble range. We found it great for watching videos. Meanwhile, Scout Mode is squarely aimed at gamers. It theoretically makes enemy noises like footsteps louder.</p><p> For the tinkerers out there, Sound Blaster provides a myriad of audio adjustments through their Z-Series software package.</p><p> When testing Scout Mode in_Overwatch_ , we did not find the adjustment helpful; Scout Mode made our enemies’ and our allies’ movements louder, making it harder to tell where the enemy was coming from. Without adjustments,<em>Overwatch’s</em> audio already makes the enemies’ movements louder than your allies’, making Scout Mode not only ineffective but an active detriment to gameplay. Other games that strongly rely on situational awareness have also likely invested the time into making enemies’ movements noticeable. Overall the software modifications Sound Blaster provides are situationally useful but not the comprehensive range of options we’d like to see at this price point.</p><h2 id="Price-Unjustified-expense"><a href="#Price-Unjustified-expense" class="headerlink" title="Price: Unjustified expense"></a><strong>Price: Unjustified expense</strong></h2><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR retails for about $250, on par with other high-end consumer audio cards. Its 6.3mm audio and microphone jacks, coupled with support for headphone impedance of up to 600 ohms, gives the listener flexibility in the rest of their audio setup: no need for 6.3mm to 3.5mm adapters or extension cords. One major hardware disappointment is its lack of 7.1 surround compatibility, which is something many sound card enthusiasts prize in a high-end sound card. There are also a number of other products with better sound quality for less than the ZxR’s $250 MSRP.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short-of-less-expensive-options" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short of less expensive options"></a><strong>Competition:</strong> <strong>Falls short of less expensive options</strong></h2><p> As we’ve already emphasized, it’s difficult to recommend the aging ZxR at its inflated $250 MSRP. You can find a number of sound cards for significantly less that provide competitive performance, though they generally don’t offer the same robust software package as the ZxR.</p><p> For a fraction of the price ($99 MSRP), you could get your hands on the Schitt Audio Fulla, an external DAC&#x2F;AMP set that covers 16 to 300 ohm headphones with plenty of power and has a clean, no-nonsense design. While it doesn’t offer the level of software support as the ZxR (those who want to dive deep into live microphone sound manipulation may not find what they need), for the consumer looking to delve into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hi-res-audio-4134630" >Hi-Fi audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> this is an excellent deal.</p><p> At the $215 mark, still well below the price of the ZxR, the EVGA Nu audio card performs as well as external DAC&#x2F;AMPs in the $1,000 range. It also has minimalist software which Sound Blaster devotees may find a little feature-light, but even given the dearth of software options the EVGA Nu is the clear winner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/evga-nu-audio-card-review-4769828" >EVGA Nu Audio Card Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> For about $160, the Asus Strix Raid PRO delivers better audio than the Sound Blaster ZxR and a control module that’s more useful than the ACM. The Strix’s “control box” has a button to turn EQ presets on and off, to change output between headphones and speakers, and all the features of the ACM (save 6.3mm jacks). The EQ button, which Asus calls the Raid button, is especially useful for gamers to switch between modes in-game.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-strix-raid-pro-review-4769832" >ASUS Strix Raid PRO Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>A good card that’s showing its age.</strong></p><p> The Sound Blaster ZxR is a quality, expensive sound card, with comprehensive software features and the hardware to power great consumer headsets and microphones. The ZxR sounds good, and gamers will not be disappointed by the ZxR’s power, but audio purists and 7.1 surround fans can find cleaner performance with fewer bells and whistles for the $250 asking price of the ZxR. It’s a card that hasn’t aged well since it’s 2013 release, and one that’s been largely overshadowed by some of its competitors in the interim.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-z-review-4769764" >Sound Blaster Z <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/sound-blaster-audigy-rx-review-4769814" >Sound Blaster Audigy RX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Sound Blaster ZxR</li><li>Product Brand  Creative</li><li>UPC  Model Number SB1510</li><li>Price  $250.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2013</li><li>Product Dimensions  14.6 x 4.1 x 7.9 in.</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Main Card)  6.3mm Headphone Out, 2x 3.5mm Out, 2x RCA Out, 6.3mm Microphone In</li><li>Inputs&#x2F;Outputs (Daughterboard)  2x 3.5mm RCA In, Optical TOSLINK In, Optical TOSLINK Out</li><li>Audio Interface  PCI Express</li><li>Frequency Response  100Hz to 20kHz (microphone); 10Hz to 45kHz (headphones)</li><li>Output Signal-to-Noise Ratio  124 dB</li><li>Headphone Amplifier  16-600 ohms</li><li>Chipset  Sound Core 3D</li><li>Digital-to-Analog Converters  Burr-Brown PCM1794 and PCM1798</li><li>Headphone Op-Amps (Swappable)  New Japan Radio NJM2114D</li><li>Headphone Driver  Texas Instruments TPA6120A2</li><li>Line Out Op-Amps (Swappable)  Texas Instruments LME49710</li><li>Capacitors  Nichicon</li><li>Software  Sound Blaster Z-Series Software</li><li>What’s Included  Sound Blaster ZxR sound card, Sound Blaster DBpro card, Sound Blaster Audio Control Module, 1Optical Cable, 1x Stereo(3.5mm)-to-RCA cable, 1x DBpro cable, Quick Start Leaflet, Installation CD containing: Drivers for Windows 7 and Windows 8, Creative Software Suite, User’s Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-a-comprehensive-guide-to-modern-versatile-game-recording-software-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Comprehensive Guide to Modern, Versatile Game Recording Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-experts-guide-to-the-best-ipad-voice-recording-tools-3-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expert's Guide to the Best iPad Voice Recording Tools #3 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/advancements-from-pci-sig-new-copperlink-cable-solutions-set-to-revolutionize-pcie-5-and-6-connections-keep-an-eye-out-for-the-upcoming-pcie-7-standard/"><u>Advancements From PCI-SIG: New CopperLink Cable Solutions Set to Revolutionize PCIe 5 and #6 Connections; Keep an Eye Out for the Upcoming PCIe 7 Standard</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/1723262349631-ayaneo-unveils-the-newly-launched-amd-driven-mini-pc-the-classic-macintosh-revival-now-in-retail/"><u>Ayaneo Unveils the Newly Launched AMD-Driven Mini PC: The Classic Macintosh Revival - Now in Retail!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/chatgpt-vs-bing-bot-showdown-a-comprehensive-breakdown-of-their-10-main-distinctions/"><u>ChatGPT Vs.

This tiny device (via<a class="link"   href="https://liliputing.com/onexplayer-m1-is-a-mini-pc-with-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-oculink-and-usb4/" >Liliputing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) has the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to 32 GB of RAM. It also has an RJ45 port, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2, meaning you have three different connectivity options.</p><p> This tiny device has a 200 mm x 120 mm footprint, making it highly portable—it’s so small that you can fit it inside a relatively loose pocket. It also weighs 600 grams, so you don’t have to worry about hurting your back if you want to move your mini-PC.</p><p> However, this small size means that the mini-PC has only limited slots. It can only accommodate a single M.2 2280 SSD and one SODIMM slot so you can say goodbye to the advantages of dual-channel memory.</p><p> Nevertheless, the OneXPlayer M1 does not lack physical ports to connect your devices. It has two USB4 Type-C ports, one USB 3.2 and one USB 2.0 Type-A port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, an RJ45 ethernet jack, a 3.5 mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outlet, and a microSD card reader. More importantly, it also comes with an OCuLink port to give you the option to provide it with the graphical oomph of the OneXGPU eGPU.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Image 1 of 5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p> Aside from the Power button, One-Netbook also gave its mini-PC an RGB button to adjust the RGB lights on the case. But what’s interesting is that the Turbo button from PCs in the 1980s and 1990s is returning on the OneXPlayer M1. The Turbo button will push the 185H’s power draw from the base 45 to 60 watts — just five watts short of its maximum configurable TDP. A 100-watt USB-C power supply also powers the mini-PC, so you’ll have ample power, even pushing the processor to its limit.</p><p> The OneXPlayer M1 has almost the same shape and size as the OneXGPU, with the external GPU weighing about 250 grams heavier. The latter also features several ports, including two HDMI ports, two DisplayPort outlets, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a USB4 Type-C port with 100 watts reverse power delivery, and a gigabit RJ45 port. This makes both devices perfect for each other, allowing you to get a fully featured computer you could put in two pockets.</p><p> Pre-orders for a 32 GB RAM &#x2F; 1 TB SSD OneXPlayer M1 are already in Japan at JPY142,310 (or around $900). But if you bundle it with the OneXGPU, you get a 10% discount on the eGPU. So, if you’re looking for a small PC you can quickly move around but don’t sacrifice performance and graphical power, you should watch out for the OneXPlayer M1 mini-PC.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp;

For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don’t post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfollow-apps-twitter.jpg"                      alt="unfollow apps"                ></p><p>If you are having a tough time deciding which <strong>unfollow apps</strong> you should use, you are at the right place because in this article we are going to present top seven options that are currently available at the market.</p><p>Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.</p><h2 id="7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter"><a href="#7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter"></a>7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter</h2><p>Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.</p><h4 id="1-SocialOopmph"><a href="#1-SocialOopmph" class="headerlink" title="1.

Videos are one of the most engaging and eye-catching sources of information. Human nature prefers an easy and convenient way to get the required information such as videos instead of reading an entire article or post. Unfortunately, there is a common problem of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome for most Twitter users. There can so many distinct reasons that might be causing such a problem. If you are the one who is facing the issue of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, then this article is for you. By following the methods discussed in this article, the videos will start to auto-play while you scroll through the Twitter Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gif-from-twitter.gif"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There could be so many reasons for Twitter videos not playing in Chrome.

Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn’t have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Flash-for-Twitter"><a href="#Flash-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Flash for Twitter"></a>Flash for Twitter</h4></li></ol><p>If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the ‘Lock’ icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to ‘Site Settings.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix2.jpg"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix2"                ></p><p>In the window of settings, you will find flash in this list. Click the drop-down in front of flash and select ‘Allow’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix3"                ></p><p>This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Whether you are a walker, runner, swimmer, cyclist, or a general health enthusiast, the Fitbit Inspire HR provides all the key insights you need to stay active and at the top of your game. It features the calorie- and step-counting functions that<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-fitbit-4176010" >Fitbit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is known for, and as a new feature, the Fitbit Inspire HR includes 24&#x2F;7 heart rate tracking, which can help you assess your progress throughout training by charting your heart rate, workouts, and sleep quality.</p><p> We recently put the Inspire HR to the test to evaluate how the inclusion of heart rate functions augments Fitbit’s core wellness model. We wore the Inspire HR continually for a week of daily training runs, day-to-day activities, and while sleeping to get a picture of how the fitness tracker can provide valuable perspectives for any training goal while remaining a budget-oriented fitness tracker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/EVe-neqYdJ7lSX6koaCLTE-Ce7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4057119-03-e8135fa8ae7a4844b3c42b45731c6a35.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Inspire HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Design-Low-profile-comfortable-and-intuitive"><a href="#Design-Low-profile-comfortable-and-intuitive" class="headerlink" title="Design: Low-profile, comfortable, and intuitive"></a><strong>Design: Low-profile, comfortable, and intuitive</strong></h2><p> No one wants to feel weighed down by a clunky fitness watch, and Fitbit has designed the Inspire HR to be super light and agile at only 0.64 ounces. It comes standard with two wristbands, one small and one large, measuring five inches and 6.25 inches long, respectively. The wristbands are a little over a half an inch wide and are made of a soft polymer material, making the Inspire HR very comfortable to wear to bed if you want to take advantage of the sleep monitoring capabilities.</p><p> The unit feels more like a bracelet than a watch—it’s so light and unobtrusive that you can easily forget you’re wearing it. And for a device that aims to deliver around-the-clock health data, this is a big advantage.</p><p> The unit feels more like a bracelet than a watch—it’s so light and unobtrusive that you can easily forget you’re wearing it.</p><p> The Inspire HR has all your health stats and apps available at the swipe of a finger. This is really a testament to the effectiveness of the fitness tracker’s minimal but routine-oriented design. You can monitor your heart rate 24&#x2F;7 without having to think about it, and you can also set up the Inspire HR to automatically detect when you start running without having to select the exercise app. It seems designed to keep your interactions with it to a minimum.</p><p> The backlit<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/oled-organic-led-4151091" >OLED <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> touchscreen is very minimal, measuring about 1.5 inches tall and a little over a half an inch wide. It serves as a digital clock face with your current heart rate below as a default, and simple vertical and horizontal swipe commands will scroll you through the different features. In accordance with its slim dimensions, the touchscreen displays its main graphics as vertically-oriented elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0gwdaOIQKIt8c8pet5IIsJQo0a8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4057119-04-149ffa04853d425587e8b38d80542ed7.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Inspire HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Sync-with-the-Fitbit-app-and-you’re-ready-to-wear"><a href="#Setup-Process-Sync-with-the-Fitbit-app-and-you’re-ready-to-wear" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Sync with the Fitbit app and you’re ready to wear"></a><strong>Setup Process: Sync with the Fitbit app and you’re ready to wear</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR is simple to set up. You’ll need to connect it to the Fitbit app, which is available on both iOS and Android platforms, and the pairing process is very straightforward.</p><p> The entire setup takes about ten minutes, and the Fitbit app will give you quick tips for using your fitness tracker. Then you are all ready to go.</p><h2 id="Performance-However-you-exercise-there’s-an-app-for-that"><a href="#Performance-However-you-exercise-there’s-an-app-for-that" class="headerlink" title="Performance: However you exercise, there’s an app for that"></a><strong>Performance: However you exercise, there’s an app for that</strong></h2><p> The Fitbit Inspire HR has a host of different exercise apps for whatever activities you enjoy and features specific modes for running, biking, swimming, treadmill workouts, weight lifting, and interval training.</p><p> As you exercise, the touchscreen allows you to scroll through various metrics to receive mid-session feedback. In Run mode, for instance, the Inspire HR will show you elapsed time, the distance you’ve covered, current mile pace, average mile pace, current heart rate, calories burned, the number of steps during your workout, as well as the digital clock face.</p><p> Unlike more high-end fitness smartwatches, the Inspire HR does not have built-in GPS. It instead calculates your distance and approximate mile pace by measuring your stride length with its in-built step counting technology. To get the most accurate GPS data, you will need to use Fitbit’s “connected GPS” feature. This requires you to take your smartphone along with you during your workout so the Inspire HR can access your phone’s GPS signal.</p><p> Although the mid-workout metrics referenced above are great for real-time monitoring, the relatively small touchscreen can be a challenge to navigate and refer to when exercising. Sweaty fingers or water on the device makes scrolling through your stats a challenge, too. While testing the Run mode on a hot and sweaty afternoon, it often took us a few attempts to use the touch commands.</p><p> Although the mid-workout metrics are great for real-time monitoring, the relatively small touchscreen can be a challenge to navigate and refer to when exercising.</p><p> One of the more advanced features of the Inspire HR is its combination of continuous heart rate monitoring and sleep monitoring. This fitness tracker has an optical heart rate monitor that uses photoplethysmography (PPG) technology to measure your pulse and gauge your heart rate, shining a rapidly-pulsating LED into your skin and measuring how your blood flow affects the dispersion of light. The Inspire HR is continually tracking your heart rate this way.</p><p> Sleep monitoring is another insightful feature that the Inspire HR offers. When synced with the Fitbit app, it can provide you with data on how long you spend in the different stages of sleep as a way to gauge the quality of your rest. This is especially useful for rigorous exercise training, such as training to race a marathon or set a PR.</p><p> If you simply wear the Inspire HR to bed, it will automatically detect when you are asleep through a combined lack of movement and changes in your heart rate patterns, known as heart rate variability (HRV). It will be able to tell how much time you spend in light, deep, and REM stages, and give you a more accurate chart of your resting heart rate. The value of sleep data for athletic performance makes sleep monitoring an accessible and highly beneficial entry point to gain in-depth insights into your body’s recovery and performance physiology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/kpOf5qE4yUp_TsA4L5ERLgL3tbM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/01LW4057119-02-e84796705da049fbb75f5e2a098c1e8e.jpg"                      alt="Fitbit Inspire HR"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Todd Braylor</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134496/18498" target="_top" id="2134496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134496/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Maximum-capacity-designed-for-24-7-wear"><a href="#Battery-Maximum-capacity-designed-for-24-7-wear" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Maximum capacity designed for 24&#x2F;7 wear"></a><strong>Battery: Maximum capacity designed for 24&#x2F;7 wear</strong></h2><p> The extended battery life of the Inspire HR makes for a true 24&#x2F;7 wellness monitoring experience. You can wear the Inspire HR for several days of activity on end.</p><p> Fitbit claims the Inspire HR battery will last up to five days with a full charge. We found this to be true—the unit we tested lasted a little over five full days before draining down to zero. Charging the Inspire HR took only about two hours before it was back at 100% again.</p><p> The extended battery life of the Inspire HR makes for a true 24&#x2F;7 wellness monitoring experience.</p><h2 id="Software-Features-Limited-to-the-Fitbit-wellness-model"><a href="#Software-Features-Limited-to-the-Fitbit-wellness-model" class="headerlink" title="Software Features: Limited to the Fitbit wellness model"></a><strong>Software Features: Limited to the Fitbit wellness model</strong></h2><p> The Inspire HR delivers all the key features that Fitbit has built its brand name around, but beyond the exercise apps, the software capabilities of the model are limited. One of the only extra features it has is the ability to show you call and text notifications when in Bluetooth range of your smartphone.</p><p> This fitness tracker is centered around displaying Fitbit’s core stats and exercise apps in combination with its heart rate functions. Integration with the Fitbit app is the best way to review your metrics in expanded categories, such as how many days out of the week you have elevated your heart rate enough for the Fitbit to log an exercise session (Fitbit refers to this as “active minutes”).</p><p> You can also set weekly goals for yourself with the Fitbit app, like aiming to hit a certain number of steps, and the Inspire HR will let you know how you’re doing and encourage you to move with notifications.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-host-of-insights-at-a-good-price"><a href="#Price-A-host-of-insights-at-a-good-price" class="headerlink" title="Price: A host of insights at a good price"></a><strong>Price: A host of insights at a good price</strong></h2><p> At a reasonable $99.95 MSRP, the Fitbit Inspire HR can help anyone find the motivation to be more active. There are more budget-friendly fitness trackers out there, including several cheaper models from Fitbit. But the addition of heart rate monitoring and sleep tracking of the Fitbit Inspire HR—combined with the numerous exercise apps—means you get a really good amount of functionality for $100.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130891/7443" target="_top" id="2130891">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130891" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130891/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Fitbit-Inspire-HR-vs-Garmin-vivosport"><a href="#Fitbit-Inspire-HR-vs-Garmin-vivosport" class="headerlink" title="Fitbit Inspire HR vs. Garmin vívosport"></a><strong>Fitbit Inspire HR vs. Garmin vívosport</strong></h2><p> One of the main competitors to Fitbit in the active wearables market is Garmin. The Garmin vívosport activity tracker is a competitor to the Fitbit Inspire HR and mimics its slim wristband design.</p><p> The vívosport features optical heart rate monitoring capabilities and has some extra features oriented specifically towards runners that the Fitbit Inspire HR does not include. The Garmin has full GPS, a VO2 max meter, and an altimeter for ascent and descent tracking. The Garmin Vivosport has a more expensive retail price of $169.99, but you can often find it on sale for around $120. Whether or not an extra chunk of change is worth the extra features is, of course, up to you and your fitness needs.</p><p> These additional features are staples of Garmin’s more advanced GPS watches that typically target a slightly different demographic than Fitbit. In this respect, one of the biggest selling points for the Fitbit Inspire HR is the integration of the brand’s popular and straightforward wellness model within its exercise apps. For example, the Run mode will calculate how many steps you took during your workout in addition to heart rate, duration, and distance metrics, making the accomplishment of total step count goals for any given day more accessible.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A motivating and wallet-friendly way to achieve wellness and performance goals.</strong></p><p> With the addition of continuous heart rate monitoring, the Fitbit Inspire HR turns the Fitbit app and its motivational metrics into a successful formula for a healthy lifestyle that any athlete can appreciate. Despite having a small display, the Inspire HR has a ton of training potential, and at a reasonable price.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Inspire HR</li><li>Product Brand  Fitbit</li><li>UPC  811138033316</li><li>Price  $99.95</li><li>Weight  0.64 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  8.5 x 0.63 x 0.5 in.</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited</li><li>Compatibility  iPhone, Android, Windows 10</li><li>Connectivity  Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth LE</li><li>Ports  USB charging</li><li>Battery capacity  Up to 5 days</li><li>Waterproof  Yes, up to 50 meters</li><li>Display  Grayscale OLED Touchscreen</li><li>Heart Rate Monitor  Yes</li><li>Memory Capacity  7 days of activity data, 30 days of daily totals</li><li>What’s included  Fitbit Inspire HR, small wrist band, large wrist band, USB charging cable</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-voice-over-basics-from-script-to-screen/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Voice-Over Basics From Script to Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-gaming-galore-top-10-virtual-reality-for-phones/"><u>[Updated] Gaming Galore Top 10 Virtual Reality for Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/advanced-hardware-analysis-and-tips-by-toms-tech-experts/"><u>Advanced Hardware Analysis and Tips by Tom's Tech Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/astral-archive-top-performers-and-enthusi-written-by-user/"><u>Astral Archive: Top Performers & Enthusi Written by User</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/eduverse-a-new-dimension-for-linguistic-education/"><u>Eduverse: A New Dimension for Linguistic Education</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-depth-analysis-and-comparison-of-gear-by-toms-hardware-experts/"><u>In-Depth Analysis and Comparison of Gear by Tom's Hardware Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/unleashing-performance-the-msi-codex-r2-desktop-gaming-setup-reviewed-and-tested/"><u>Unleashing Performance: The MSI CODEX R2 Desktop Gaming Setup Reviewed and Tested</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
