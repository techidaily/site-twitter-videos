Videos are one of the most engaging and eye-catching sources of information. Human nature prefers an easy and convenient way to get the required information such as videos instead of reading an entire article or post. Unfortunately, there is a common problem of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome for most Twitter users. There can so many distinct reasons that might be causing such a problem. If you are the one who is facing the issue of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, then this article is for you. By following the methods discussed in this article, the videos will start to auto-play while you scroll through the Twitter Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gif-from-twitter.gif"                      alt="Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There could be so many reasons for Twitter videos not playing in Chrome. We will go through each reason one by one and try to solve all those reasons to see which one works for you.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download Twitter Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><ol><li><h4 id="Twitter-Video-Format"><a href="#Twitter-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="Twitter Video Format"></a>Twitter Video Format</h4></li></ol><p>One of the most important aspects to consider while fixing this problem is checking if the video that is not being played has the correct format. Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn’t have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Flash-for-Twitter"><a href="#Flash-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Flash for Twitter"></a>Flash for Twitter</h4></li></ol><p>If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter. If the flash is not enabled in your Chrome browser, it will not play videos. To enable flash for Twitter, after visiting Twitter, click on the ‘Lock’ icon placed on the left side of the address bar and go to ‘Site Settings.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix2.jpg"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix2"                ></p><p>In the window of settings, you will find flash in this list. Click the drop-down in front of flash and select ‘Allow’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix3"                ></p><p>This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos. If this was the reason behind the Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, allowing flash will solve this problem.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Clear-Cookies-and-Cache"><a href="#Clear-Cookies-and-Cache" class="headerlink" title="Clear Cookies and Cache"></a>Clear Cookies and Cache</h4></li></ol><p>Clearing cookies and cache can solve multiple problems related to web browsers.

Disable each of these extensions one by one.</p><p>After disabling all the extensions, reload the page and see if the videos are playing or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix8.jpg"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix8"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Disable-Hardware-Acceleration"><a href="#Disable-Hardware-Acceleration" class="headerlink" title="Disable Hardware Acceleration"></a>Disable Hardware Acceleration</h4></li></ol><p>Is it still not working?

National flags are typically rectangular or square in shape, characterized by their distinct colors, patterns, and symbols”.</p><p> Our local model came close, stating that “The Indian National Flag has five sides and was designed in 1916 to represent India’s independence movement.” While this flag did exist and did have five sides, it was the flag of the Indian Home Rule Movement—not a national flag.</p><p> None of our models could respond that the correct term for a pea-shaped object is “pisiform,” with ChatGPT going so far as to suggest that peas have a “three-dimensional geometric shape that is perfectly round and symmetrical.”</p><p> All three chatbots correctly identified Franco Malerba as an Italian astronaut and member of the European Parliament, with Bard giving an answer worded identically to a section of Malerba’s Wikipedia entry.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137380/7443" target="_top" id="2137380">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137380" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137380/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Technical-Instructions"><a href="#Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Technical-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Which LLM Is Good for Technical Instructions?"></a>Which LLM Is Good for Technical Instructions?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/burnt-socket-for-a-bs-1363-type-plug.jpg"                      alt="burnt socket for a  BS 1363 type plug"                ></p><p> When you have technical problems, you might be tempted to turn to a chatbot for help. While technology marches on, some things remain the same. The BS 1363 electrical plug has been in use in Britain, Ireland, and many other countries since 1947. We asked the language models how to correctly wire it up.</p><p> Cables attaching to the plug have a live wire (brown), an earth wire (yellow&#x2F;green), and a neutral wire (blue). These must be attached to the correct terminals within the plug housing.</p><p> Our Dalai implementation correctly identified the plug as “English-style,” then veered off-course and instead gave instructions for the older round-pin BS 546 plug together with older wiring colors.</p><p> ChatGPT was slightly more helpful. It correctly labeled the wiring colors and gave a materials list and a set of eight instructions. ChatGPT also suggested putting the brown wire into the terminal labeled “L,” the blue wire into the “N” terminal, and the yellow wire into “E.” This would be correct if BS1363 terminals were labeled, but they aren’t.</p><p> Bard identified the correct colors for the wires and instructed us to connect them to Live, Neutral, and Earth terminals. It gave no instructions on how to identify these.</p><p> In our opinion. none of the chatbots gave instructions sufficient to help someone correctly wire a BS 1363 electrical plug. A concise and correct response would be, “Blue on the left, brown on the right.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Writing-Code"><a href="#Which-LLM-Is-Good-for-Writing-Code" class="headerlink" title="Which LLM Is Good for Writing Code?"></a>Which LLM Is Good for Writing Code?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asdfasdf.jpg"                      alt="MicroPython logo with snake sitting on a microchip"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-python-used-for/" >Python is a useful programming language <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that runs on most modern platforms.

To each of our models, we gave the simple prompt: “Create an original and funny joke.”</p><p> Fortunately for comedians everywhere and the human race at large, none of the models were capable of generating an original joke.</p><p> Bard rolled out the classic, “Why did the scarecrow win an award? He was outstanding in his field”.</p><p> Both our local implementation and ChatGPT offered the groan-worthy, “Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!”</p><p> A derivative but original joke would be, “How are Large Language Models like atoms? They both make things up!”</p><p>You read it here first, folks.</p><h2 id="No-Chatbot-Is-Perfect"><a href="#No-Chatbot-Is-Perfect" class="headerlink" title="No Chatbot Is Perfect"></a>No Chatbot Is Perfect</h2><p> We found that while all three large language models have their advantages and disadvantages, none of them can replace the real expertise of a human being with specialized knowledge.</p><p> While both Bard and ChatGPT gave better responses to our coding question and are very easy to use, running a large language model locally means you don’t need to be concerned about privacy or censorship.</p><p> If you’d like to create great AI art without worrying that somebody’s looking over your shoulder, it’s easy to run an art AI model on your local machine, too.</p><p><ins

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100527/7443" target="_top" id="2100527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile.

Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite-3"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite-3" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-3"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148773/18498" target="_top" id="2148773">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148773" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148773/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123734/7443" target="_top" id="2123734">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123734" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123734/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-personalize-twitter-video-thumbnail/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Personalize Twitter Video Thumbnail</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-combine-power-tweeting-and-snapping-with-snapchat/"><u>2024 Approved Combine Power Tweeting and Snapping with Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-eliminate-clutter-on-tweet-feed-with-top-20-apps/"><u>2024 Approved Eliminate Clutter on Tweet Feed with Top 20 Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/5-best-windows-programs-for-multimedia-editing/"><u>5 Best Windows Programs for Multimedia Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/1723016572409-anthem-speaker-trouble-get-your-sound-back-on-windows-10-now/"><u>Anthem Speaker Trouble?

This video demo should not be mistaken for an actually-viable<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/mini-pc" >Mini PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> project, and does not constitute any<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-pc-case-fans-for-airflow-and-performance" >PC cooling advice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> 苏打baka’s name is a combination of the Chinese characters for “soda” and Japanese-Romanized “baka” meaning “fool”, so their name can effectively be translated as “Sodabaka”, “Sodafool”, or “Soda-foolish”, depending on how semantic you feel like being. We’ll use Sodabaka. Besides this project, they also do lots of other PC hardware and gaming-centric content on<a class="link"   href="https://space.bilibili.com/691415738" >their Bilibili channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Image 1 of 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Shots of the Fan PC build from throughout the original video."                ></p><p> (Image credit: 苏打baka on Bilibili)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Shots of the Fan PC build from throughout the original video."                ></p><p> (Image credit: 苏打baka on Bilibili)</p><p> Now, let’s talk a little more about the details of the PC build in question. Sodabaka essentially took an old Intel Sandybridge-era<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-mini-itx-pc-cases" >Mini ITX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> motherboard and tested its operation while attached to a spinning fan.</p><p> The first attempt at this used a smaller CPU heatsink that didn’t adequately cool the system, even while it was spinning, with tests showing the processor reaching 100 degrees Celsius. However, this did function as a general proof of concept that you could make a PC spin violently at the center of a fan and still have it operate without issue.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> So, when moving onto the final testing of the fan PC build, Sodabaka instead used an even larger passive air cooler — which may have been a good idea, if the final testing of the PC build didn’t also include steadily ramping up the speed of fan upon which the entire PC spins. While the beefier-cooler version of the fan PC does seemed to work, as far as its principle functionality went, its final testing run ended in disaster.</p><p> So, what happened? Did the static buildup short out the PC or something? Fortunately, nothing so mundane.

Since 2010 the Twitter’s own advertising platform has enabled countless businesses of all sizes to reach new markets, extend their target audiences and generate profit. From the start, the platform fostered a brand-friendly atmosphere that helped small and medium-sized businesses grow.</p><p> More than half of social media managers think that Twitter is the platform that leads the market in terms of return of investment since 94 percent of the social network’s users have claimed that they planned to buy a product after discovering it on Twitter. In this article, we are going to show you how to advertise on Twitter.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter"><a href="#Types-of-Advertising-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Types of Advertising on Twitter"></a>Types of Advertising on Twitter</h2><p> If your company has reached the decision to start advertising on Twitter, there are three different ways in which you can accomplish this. Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts all offer different opportunities, so let’s take a closer look at each of these options.</p><h4 id="1-Promoted-Accounts"><a href="#1-Promoted-Accounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Promoted Accounts"></a>1. Promoted Accounts</h4><p> As much as 85 percent of users have reported that promoted accounts helped them find new businesses that offer products they were looking for. The true purpose of promoted accounts is to make your Twitter account visible to the audience you targeted and gain more followers in such a manner.</p><p> Promoted accounts appear in timelines of Twitter users that fit in your target group and they also appear in Who to Follow recommendations or search results. If you choose to promote an account you’ll be able to increase its visibility and availability to your potential customers.</p><h4 id="2-Promoted-Tweets"><a href="#2-Promoted-Tweets" class="headerlink" title="2. Promoted Tweets"></a>2. Promoted Tweets</h4><p> Any post you share on Twitter is called a tweet, and a promoted tweet is just the type of tweet a brand paid for so it can reach more people. A promoted tweet is displayed on the user’s timelines, Twitter’s mobile app or high in the search results. You can comment on, retweet or like promoted tweets, which creates a great opportunity to present the services your company offers to Twitter users who don’t follow your account. They also enable you to pick a target group and recommend the products you think they might need.</p><h4 id="3-Promoted-Trends"><a href="#3-Promoted-Trends" class="headerlink" title="3. Promoted Trends"></a>3. Promoted Trends</h4><p> A trend on Twitter is defined as a topic that is most frequently talked about at the moment. You can find the latest trending subjects in the Discover tab on your Twitter account, so using a promoted trend to advertise your brand’s products and services allows you to promote a hashtag at the very top of the Discover tab.</p><p> After someone clicks on the hashtag, they will be able to see a tweet you’re promoting as well as a list of results for the given topic. If people start using that hashtag, more Twitter users will learn about your promoted tweet and enable you to grow the number of your followers organically.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#Types-of-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>Types of Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Combining several ad products is the most common method of creating an ad campaign on Twitter, although you can also use a single ad product for the same purpose. These are the types of ad campaigns most frequently used by marketers on Twitter.</p><h4 id="Tweet-Engagements"><a href="#Tweet-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Tweet Engagements"></a>Tweet Engagements</h4><p> This a simple ad campaign that focuses on increasing the number of people talking about your brand on Twitter. You only have to pay for the first engagement with a user, while all other results of your campaign are free.</p><h4 id="Lead-Generation"><a href="#Lead-Generation" class="headerlink" title="Lead Generation"></a>Lead Generation</h4><p> This service enables you to create Lead Generation cards in Twitter’s ad manager, which contain the user’s email address and their real name as well as their username on the platform. You can download the list of possible leads from your Twitter Ads account.</p><h4 id="Clicks-and-Conversions"><a href="#Clicks-and-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="Clicks and Conversions"></a>Clicks and Conversions</h4><p> This advertising strategy is aimed at driving as much traffic to your website as possible. The service is paid on per click basis, so you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a campaign that isn’t producing results.</p><h4 id="Awareness-and-Followers"><a href="#Awareness-and-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Awareness and Followers"></a>Awareness and Followers</h4><p> If you want to increase the brand awareness, then an awareness campaign is the best solution. This type of campaign presents your profile to an audience you can’t reach and it is the only type of campaign that is based on impressions rather than on engagement rates. Follower campaigns are aimed at increasing the follower base on your Twitter account.</p><h4 id="Fees-and-Payment"><a href="#Fees-and-Payment" class="headerlink" title="Fees and Payment"></a>Fees and Payment</h4><p> Twitter Ads enables you to choose between self-service and full service. If you choose to create your campaign independently you’ll be in charge of the entire process, while the full-service system also includes support from the platform.</p><p> In either case, you will only have to pay for the achieved results, while the rate you’ll pay for each click is determined through the auction system.</p><h2 id="How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns"><a href="#How-to-Set-up-Twitter-Ad-Campaigns" class="headerlink" title="How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns"></a>How to Set up Twitter Ad Campaigns</h2><p> Creating a new ad campaign is a simple process that can be completed in just four steps. Here’s how you can set up your first Twitter ad campaign and start enjoying its benefits.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="twitter ads 1"                ></p><p> Open Twitter Ads Manager.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?!

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game.

In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elite-gimbal-solutions-youtube-creators-stabilizing-allies/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elite Gimbal Solutions YouTube Creators' Stabilizing Allies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-insiders-manual-reacting-on-twitter-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Insider’s Manual Reacting on Twitter Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-crafting-memorable-tweets-video-integration/"><u>[New] Crafting Memorable Tweets Video Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-navigating-snapchats-zoom-for-crisp-visuals/"><u>[New] Navigating Snapchat's Zoom for Crisp Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/updated-clipcomposer-critique-thorough-examination/"><u>[Updated] ClipComposer Critique – Thorough Examination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-from-creation-to-consumption-posting-vids-on-twtplustumb/"><u>[Updated] From Creation to Consumption Posting Vids on Twt+Tumb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-top-tweets-from-tiktok-stars-a-viral-snapshot-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top Tweets From TikTok Stars A Viral Snapshot for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cutting-edge-actions-screening-tech-report/"><u>2024 Approved Cutting-Edge Actions Screening Tech Report</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/desbloquea-tu-dvd-regional-transforma-un-disco-de-region-locked-en-region-free-con-windows-10-8-o-7/"><u>Desbloquea Tu DVD Regional: Transforma Un Disco De Region Locked en Región-Free Con Windows 10, 8 O 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-ipad-or-apple-iphone-15-plus-stuck-on-activation-lock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Fix iPad or Apple iPhone 15 Plus Stuck On Activation Lock?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-downloading-twitters-animated-content-simplified/"><u>In 2024, Downloading Twitter's Animated Content Simplified</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-peering-into-popularity-twitters-top-videos/"><u>In 2024, Peering Into Popularity Twitter’s Top Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-quadcopter-mechanics-decoded-flight-patterns-and-functionality/"><u>In 2024, Quadcopter Mechanics Decoded Flight Patterns & Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-blog.techidaily.com/1723012389973-mastering-the-dark-mode-dilemma-in-halo-infinite-now-solved/"><u>Mastering the Dark Mode Dilemma in Halo Infinite - Now Solved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/the-roadmap-to-thriving-in-twitter-live-broadcasts-for-2024/"><u>The Roadmap to Thriving in Twitter Live Broadcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-time-travel-how-to-flip-videos-for-2024/"><u>YouTube Time Travel How to Flip Videos for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, you can insert “+something” between your username and the @gmail extension to create email aliases which Gmail just regards the them as the same address and delivers the email directly to your nomal Gmail account. All emails from your new Twitter account will be sent to your original email address, even though you added the “+something” to it.

Logging to multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously is only possible if you access the platform from different web browsers or if you are using <a class="link"   href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" >TweetDeck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature that allows its users to manage two or more Twitter accounts from the same browser.</p><p> Was this article helpful?

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program.

All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing. The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite-3"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite-3" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-3"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-3" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)"></a>3. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1521325/16446" target="_top" id="1521325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1521325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1521325/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man-3"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="5. The Wheel of Time"></a>5. The Wheel of Time</h3><p>The Wheel of Time, published by Amazon, is based on another famous high fantasy novel series and aspires to be the next Game of Thrones. It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season.

Eight years later, things seem as if they took the turn for the worse because the number of the platform’s monthly users is shrinking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-monthly-active-users.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In the last quarter of 2017, Twitter had only 330 million users, much less than Facebook that had 2,07 billion users or Instagram that had approximately 700 million users over that same period. Despite being easy to use and a powerful tool for reaching like-minded people or potential customers for your company’s products Twitter is slowly losing the reputation it once had.</p><h2 id="Why-Leave-Twitter"><a href="#Why-Leave-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Why Leave Twitter?"></a>Why Leave Twitter?</h2><p>At the end of the last year, the platform has increased the number of characters that can be used in a post, but this move did almost nothing to restore Twitter’s former glory. Celebrities getting caught up in Twitter wars, fake accounts and ultra-right-wing supporters have all contributed to the current state of affairs on Twitter. Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144274/7443" target="_top" id="2144274">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144274" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144274/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. Tumblr</h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. Plurk</h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device. Although it doesn’t offer the same features as Twitter, Musical.ly is still an interesting alternative for this declining social network.</p><h4 id="4-Gab-ai"><a href="#4-Gab-ai" class="headerlink" title="4. Gab.ai"></a>4. Gab.ai</h4><p>Free speech supporters are going to love using Gab.ai, a social network that has had their mobile app banned from both Google Play and the App Store, for failing to comply with their policies on adult content. Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. Instagram</h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands.

Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902278/19272" target="_top" id="1902278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902278/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you!

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868499/19272" target="_top" id="1868499">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868499" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868499/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Scheduled for March 19, the bare metal vs. raw power event is set to become a must-watch experience of the annual CloudFest conference.</p><p> According to the dedicated event page,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/39-year-old-477-mhz-dos-web-server-hits-2500-hours-of-uptime" >server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throwing began in Holland about a decade ago and is an “intense underground sport, which has been criticized as ‘needlessly brutal to servers’.” This sport is now emerging from its data-center basement origins and is set to enter the world stage at CloudFest 2024.</p><p> CloudFest provides a few details regarding the 2024 World Server Throwing Championship. This outdoor event in front of a live audience will welcome “up to 40 server-throwing athletes.” All genders and ability levels are welcome to participate as long as they desire to throw a server a great distance. Every athlete will get two measured attempts at server throwing and will hope to be placed in the top three so they can win a prize.</p><p> Though the sport is brutal by its very nature, it is good to see that participants at previous events always wear gloves. Some servers have very sharp edges. If you plan to attend, it might be wise to stand behind participants rather than to the left or right in case of server hurling misjudgment.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> It isn’t clear if there are 1U, 2U, and 4U divisions, or, dare we say it, 8U for the real heavy lifters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtmZvaBCUd7W2J88EkoF6b-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Server throwing athletes"                ></p><p> (Image credit: CloudFest)</p><p> If we had to place a bet on the winner’s nationality, it would probably be Dutch, as the country where the sport seems to have become established. We discovered that some of the WTSC partners have already promoted server throwing in Dutch events. The winner of a Dutch national championship event<a class="link"   href="https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/agenda/summer-bbq-dutch-cloud-community-2022/" >in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> managed to fling a 10kg+ (22 pounds +) server 12.23 meters (over 40 feet).</p><p> We think there is plenty of room for improvement on the 2022 winning throw. Remember, the world record distance for throwing a 16-pound shot put is nearly 75 feet. For another comparison, in the Swedish sport of Stångstörtning, a roughly 57-pound log is tossed, with the world record distance being 32 feet. Much will depend on how well-tuned and trained the WSTC 2024 athletes are…</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> The CloudFest 2024 event occurs at Europa-park in Rust,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-submits-schematics-for-1nm-chip-fabs-in-germany-two-new-fabs-open-in-2027" >Germany <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , from March 18 to 24.

However, you can insert “+something” between your username and the @gmail extension to create email aliases which Gmail just regards the them as the same address and delivers the email directly to your nomal Gmail account. All emails from your new Twitter account will be sent to your original email address, even though you added the “+something” to it. This simple hack will allow you to manage multiple accounts from the same email address.</p><h2 id="Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web"><a href="#Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?"></a>Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?</h2><p> Accessing a few different Twitter accounts from the same web browser isn’t an option since you first have to log out from one account in order to be able to log in to another one within the same web browser. Logging to multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously is only possible if you access the platform from different web browsers or if you are using <a class="link"   href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" >TweetDeck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature that allows its users to manage two or more Twitter accounts from the same browser.</p><p> Was this article helpful?

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features.

The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don’t post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfollow-apps-twitter.jpg"                      alt="unfollow apps"                ></p><p>If you are having a tough time deciding which <strong>unfollow apps</strong> you should use, you are at the right place because in this article we are going to present top seven options that are currently available at the market.</p><p>Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.</p><h2 id="7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter"><a href="#7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter"></a>7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter</h2><p>Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.</p><h4 id="1-SocialOopmph"><a href="#1-SocialOopmph" class="headerlink" title="1. SocialOopmph"></a>1. SocialOopmph</h4><p>SocialOomph is much more than just a simple unfollow tool because it enables its users to schedule tweets, track hashtags or manage multiple Twitter accounts.

People have their preferences now as there are quite a few available options.</p><p>All of this content sharing is not limited to a single app or is not bound to remain inside the limits of one social media platform. People often find it difficult to share videos across cross-platform. Below are a few ways to share Twitter videos on Snapchat with and without a link.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat"><a href="#How-to-Share-Videos-on-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Videos on Snapchat"></a>How to Share Videos on Snapchat</h2><p>The popular one of its kind social media platform Snapchat has many features when it comes to video sharing and content creation. You can record and share videos in many different ways with different individual groups or even upload them for the public to view. You can also select a customized number of people who can view it. There are two significant ways in which you can share videos on Snapchat.</p><h2 id="Record-and-Send"><a href="#Record-and-Send" class="headerlink" title="Record and Send"></a>Record and Send</h2><p>You can always open up Snapchat, and it will launch its specialized camera for you, tap the screen once and swipe the recording button to choose from many AI filters. After you have finalized your preferred filter, press and hold the circular record button, and Snapchat will start recording. It can record videos up to 1 minute at a time, and you can later cut and trim the video if you want.</p><p>After that, all you need to do is press the blue send button, and it will show you the list of people and a ‘Your Story’ option where all your friends can see your video. It remains on the story for 24 hours and is automatically removed. If you send it to an individual, they can only view the video once or replay it once, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="Upload-from-Camera-Roll"><a href="#Upload-from-Camera-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Upload from Camera Roll"></a>Upload from Camera Roll</h2><p>Suppose you wish to upload a video in your device’s storage, open Snapchat, and swipe up from the bottom. It will take you to the saved videos in your camera roll. Choose the video you wish to share, press and hold, or tap to open and then press the blue send button. It will show you the list of friends and the upload-to-story option.</p><p>Sharing a video will allow the receiver to save it in chat or download it to their device. Otherwise, it will disappear from the chat immediately after viewing or after 24 hours of viewing, depending on your settings.</p><h2 id="How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link"><a href="#How-to-Share-Twitter-Videos-on-Snapchat-with-Link" class="headerlink" title="How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link"></a>How to Share Twitter Videos on Snapchat with Link</h2><p>People use Snapchat more often than Twitter because Twitter is considered a more formal space with restricted features. If you wish to share a Twitter video with a link on Snapchat, follow these steps to learn how to do it most efficiently.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter"><a href="#Step-1-Log-in-to-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log in to Twitter"></a>Step 1: Log in to Twitter</h2><p>Enter your credentials and log in to your Twitter account if you already have not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-1.jpg"                      alt="Log in to Twitter"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share"><a href="#Step-2-Find-the-video-and-tap-share" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find the video and tap share"></a>Step 2: Find the video and tap share</h2><p>Scroll through your Twitter feed until you come across a video you would want to share with your friends. For example, a video that shows a new feature of iOS with which you can unlock an iPhone using Face ID, but it works with a mask on as well! It is an informative video, and you want to share it. Tap the share icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-2.jpg"                      alt="Tap share"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu"><a href="#Step-3-Snapchat-from-the-pop-up-menu" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu"></a>Step 3: Snapchat from the pop-up menu</h2><p>Tapping the share icon will open a dialogue box that will show you a few options for sharing the Twitter video. Select Snapchat from the list; if you do not see Snapchat in that list, go ahead and tap on ‘share via.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-3.jpg"                      alt="Choose app"                ></p><p>This will open a list of all applications you can use to share the video. Then all you have to do is select Snapchat from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-4.jpg"                      alt="Choose Snapchat"                ></p><h2 id="Step-4-Select-the-Contact"><a href="#Step-4-Select-the-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Select the Contact"></a>Step 4: Select the Contact</h2><p>Tapping on Snapchat will close Twitter and take you to the Snapchat application with a list of all your contacts. From that list, select the contact you want to share the Twitter video with and press send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-post-twitter-videos-on-snapchat-5.jpg"                      alt="Select the Contact"                ></p><p>Doing this will send the video to the desired person with a link. The person or even you now only have to tap the link, and it will directly open Twitter and take you to the exact tweet of that video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link"><a href="#Share-Twitter-Videos-to-WhatsApp-without-Link" class="headerlink" title="Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link"></a>Share Twitter Videos to WhatsApp without Link</h2><p>Now, you have learned all the steps required to share twitter videos using Snapchat with a link, but what if the other person you have sent the video to does not use Twitter or if they cannot access the Twitter application? Then what?</p><p>There can be several other reasons you would want to send Twitter videos without a link, e.g., the video might be subject to removal, the receiver does not have Twitter, or maybe the video has to be posted somewhere else, but the link embedding does not work.</p><p>There is an easy way to overcome this issue if you wish to share Twitter Videos on Snapchat directly without any link. You will have to save the video offline by downloading it, and then you can easily share it on Snapchat without any link.
