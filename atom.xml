Videos are one of the most engaging and eye-catching sources of information. Human nature prefers an easy and convenient way to get the required information such as videos instead of reading an entire article or post. Unfortunately, there is a common problem of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome for most Twitter users. There can so many distinct reasons that might be causing such a problem. If you are the one who is facing the issue of Twitter videos not playing in Chrome, then this article is for you. By following the methods discussed in this article, the videos will start to auto-play while you scroll through the Twitter Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-gif-from-twitter.gif"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There could be so many reasons for Twitter videos not playing in Chrome.

Twitter only supports MP4 video format and A64 audio format. If any video on Twitter doesn’t have such a format, it will not play. If only a few Twitter videos are not playing in Chrome but most of the videos are playing, this might be the problem with those videos. The best way o watch those videos is to download them using a third-party downloading platform.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Flash-for-Twitter"><a href="#Flash-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Flash for Twitter"></a>Flash for Twitter</h4></li></ol><p>If you have checked the above aspect and it is not the case with your Twitter videos and non of the video is playing, you should try enabling the flash for Twitter.

Click the drop-down in front of flash and select ‘Allow’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-video-not-playing-fix3.png"                      alt="twitter-video-not-playing-fix3"                ></p><p>This will allow Twitter to use flash to play videos.

And, that’s why using the Filmora video editor is a valuable choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-efficiently-incorporate-media-in-your-tweets/"><u>[New] In 2024, Efficiently Incorporate Media in Your Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-laugh-riot-10-most-entertaining-youtube-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Laugh Riot  10 Most Entertaining YouTube Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-digital-domination-how-videos-rule-twitter/"><u>2024 Approved  Digital Domination  How Videos Rule Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-free-frame-flip-converting-tweets-into-tweenish-movies/"><u>In 2024, Free Frame Flip  Converting Tweets Into Tweenish Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-webm-transformation-from-tweeted-visuals-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] WebM Transformation From Tweeted Visuals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-social-media-game-post-tiktoks-on-twitter/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Social Media Game  Post TikToks on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hashtag-hits-top-10-viral-tiktoks-on-twitter/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Hashtag Hits  Top 10 Viral TikToks on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/integrating-vids-on-twitter-plus-tumblr-platforms/"><u>Integrating Vids on Twitter + Tumblr Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-hot-tweets-hot-views-a-new-era-of-social-media-fame/"><u>[New] Hot Tweets, Hot Views  A New Era of Social Media Fame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-tweaking-your-tweets-audience-engagement-techniques/"><u>[New] Tweaking Your Tweets  Audience Engagement Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-do-poco-m6-pro-5g-screen-sharing-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Do Poco M6 Pro 5G Screen Sharing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-exit-android-factory-mode-on-lava-blaze-2-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Exit Android Factory Mode On Lava Blaze 2? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/top-11-windows-11-secrets-unveiled-for-2024/"><u>Top 11 Windows 11 Secrets Unveiled for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/updated-content-climbing-from-zero-to-million-in-a-matter-of-seconds/"><u>[Updated] Content Climbing  From Zero to Million in a Matter of Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/how-to-flash-dead-nokia-c32-safely-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Flash Dead Nokia C32 Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-voice-over-basics-from-script-to-screen/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Voice-Over Basics  From Script to Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-flash-frame-filmmakers-plan/"><u>[New] Flash Frame Filmmaker's Plan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/updated-a-full-review-of-splice-video-editor/"><u>Updated A Full Review of Splice Video Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/mastering-virtual-worlds-compreenas-top-8-metaverse-headgear/"><u>Mastering Virtual Worlds  Compreenas Top 8 Metaverse Headgear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-camera-stabilizers-for-youtubers/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTubers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In the last ten years Facebook, Instagram or Twitter have become so popular that movies were made about them and they are constantly being referenced in popular culture. If somehow you managed to make it into 2018 without a Twitter account, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the Twitter account setup process and provide you with the information necessary to share your first tweet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Create a Twitter Account</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create Multiple Twitter Accounts With the Same Email Address</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Twitter-Account"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Twitter-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Twitter Account"></a>How to Create a Twitter Account</h2><p> Like all social media networks, Twitter can be used for a wide array of purposes, from sharing your opinions on topics you find important, to strengthening your brand’s identity. So here’s how you can open a new account on Twitter.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-on-the-Web"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-on-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Twitter account on the Web"></a>How to Create a Twitter account on the Web</h2><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p> Navigate to Twitter’s home page, using a web browser on your computer, and click on the <strong>Sign Up</strong> option. You will be asked to insert your <strong>full name, phone number, email address and a password.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-twitter-account-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p> You will have to pick a username that has no more than 15 characters. The platform will inform you if the username you’ve chosen is already taken or if it’s too long. Select a name that can be easily associated with you or the brand the Twitter account should be representing, to ensure that your followers know to whom the account belongs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-twitter-account-4.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p> Check the <strong>Keep me signed in on this computer</strong> checkbox if you are creating an account from a private computer. You can also allow the platform to customize your account based on your recent online activity by clicking on the <strong>Tailor Twitter based on my recent website visits</strong> checkbox. After you’ve entered your information, you’ll have to accept the terms and conditions and then click on the <strong>Create My Account</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p> A verification email will be sent to the email address you entered. Go to your email account, and click on the link in the message you received from Twitter, in order to verify the account you just created. Congratulations, you have successfully opened a new Twitter account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-through-a-Smartphone-App"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-through-a-Smartphone-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Twitter account through a Smartphone App"></a>How to Create a Twitter account through a Smartphone App</h2><p> Android and iPhone users can use their devices to set up a new account on Twitter. Head over to Google Play or the App Store using your Smartphone and find the Twitter application. Once it appears in the search results, click on it to initiate the download and the installation process. After the Twitter app is successfully installed on your device, tap on it to start setting up your new account.</p><p> The process of creating a new account through a Smartphone app is the same as the one we described above. So, just insert your real name, username, email address and password and then tap on the SignUp button.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Multiple-Twitter-Accounts-With-the-Same-Email-Address"><a href="#How-to-Create-Multiple-Twitter-Accounts-With-the-Same-Email-Address" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Multiple Twitter Accounts With the Same Email Address"></a>How to Create Multiple Twitter Accounts With the Same Email Address</h2><p> Using the same email address for two Twitter accounts isn’t possible, because the platform will inform you that the email is already registered and that you have to enter a different email address. However, you can insert “+something” between your username and the @gmail extension to create email aliases which Gmail just regards the them as the same address and delivers the email directly to your nomal Gmail account. All emails from your new Twitter account will be sent to your original email address, even though you added the “+something” to it. This simple hack will allow you to manage multiple accounts from the same email address.</p><h2 id="Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web"><a href="#Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?"></a>Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?</h2><p> Accessing a few different Twitter accounts from the same web browser isn’t an option since you first have to log out from one account in order to be able to log in to another one within the same web browser. Logging to multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously is only possible if you access the platform from different web browsers or if you are using <a class="link"   href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" >TweetDeck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature that allows its users to manage two or more Twitter accounts from the same browser.</p><p> Was this article helpful?

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you’re on the hunt for the <strong>best videos on Twitter</strong>, this is for you! As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/the-gif-grabbers-handbook-a-comprehensible-guide-to-downloading-twitter-gifs/"><u>The GIF Grabber's Handbook  A Comprehensible Guide to Downloading Twitter GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-screen-capture-connoisseurs-your-guide-to-preserving-twitvid-media-for-2024/"><u>[New] Screen Capture Connoisseurs  Your Guide to Preserving TwitVid Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-twitch-collection-perfectly-preserve-your-tweets/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Twitch Collection - Perfectly Preserve Your Tweets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-5-websites-for-an-active-social-presence/"><u>2024 Approved  Top 5 Websites for an Active Social Presence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamline-your-twitterscape-with-these-pc-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Streamline Your Twitterscape with These PC Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/sending-direct-tweets-share-photosvideos-on-twitter-without-retweeting-for-2024/"><u>Sending Direct Tweets  Share Photos/Videos on Twitter without Retweeting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2023-top-10-trending-videos-on-twitter/"><u>[New] 2023 | Top 10 Trending Videos on Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-boost-engagement-posting-twitter-videos-on-snapchat/"><u>2024 Approved  Boost Engagement  Posting Twitter Videos on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/harmonic-wave-of-shared-excitement-for-2024/"><u>Harmonic Wave of Shared Excitement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-apple-m1-a-computing-revolution/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling the Apple M1  A Computing Revolution?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-shifting-gender-identity-in-digital-imagery/"><u>Expert Tips for Shifting Gender Identity in Digital Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-on-your-oneplus-12-by-drfone-android/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock on your OnePlus 12</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-location-on-tiktok-to-see-more-content-on-your-itel-p40plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Location on TikTok to See More Content On your Itel P40+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/expert-advice-enhancing-control-over-snapchat-video-speed/"><u>Expert Advice  Enhancing Control Over Snapchat Video Speed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/1716069525140-new-2024-approved-capture-your-screen-on-chromebook-methods-4-you/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Capture Your Screen on Chromebook  Methods 4 You!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-proven-practice-for-preserving-playthroughs-tips-and-tricks-for-recording-roblox-gameplay-on-a-mac/"><u>2024 Approved  Proven Practice for Preserving Playthroughs  Tips & Tricks for Recording Roblox Gameplay on a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/updated-15-best-free-mp4-video-rotators-windowsmac-android-iphone-and-online-for-2024/"><u>Updated 15 Best Free MP4 Video Rotators Windows,Mac， Android, iPhone & Online for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2.

Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5.

It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad-2"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths.

In the last ten years Facebook, Instagram or Twitter have become so popular that movies were made about them and they are constantly being referenced in popular culture. If somehow you managed to make it into 2018 without a Twitter account, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the Twitter account setup process and provide you with the information necessary to share your first tweet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Create a Twitter Account</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create Multiple Twitter Accounts With the Same Email Address</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Twitter-Account"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Twitter-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Twitter Account"></a>How to Create a Twitter Account</h2><p> Like all social media networks, Twitter can be used for a wide array of purposes, from sharing your opinions on topics you find important, to strengthening your brand’s identity. So here’s how you can open a new account on Twitter.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-on-the-Web"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-on-the-Web" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Twitter account on the Web"></a>How to Create a Twitter account on the Web</h2><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p> Navigate to Twitter’s home page, using a web browser on your computer, and click on the <strong>Sign Up</strong> option. You will be asked to insert your <strong>full name, phone number, email address and a password.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-twitter-account-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p> You will have to pick a username that has no more than 15 characters. The platform will inform you if the username you’ve chosen is already taken or if it’s too long. Select a name that can be easily associated with you or the brand the Twitter account should be representing, to ensure that your followers know to whom the account belongs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-twitter-account-4.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p> Check the <strong>Keep me signed in on this computer</strong> checkbox if you are creating an account from a private computer. You can also allow the platform to customize your account based on your recent online activity by clicking on the <strong>Tailor Twitter based on my recent website visits</strong> checkbox. After you’ve entered your information, you’ll have to accept the terms and conditions and then click on the <strong>Create My Account</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p><h4 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h4><p> A verification email will be sent to the email address you entered. Go to your email account, and click on the link in the message you received from Twitter, in order to verify the account you just created. Congratulations, you have successfully opened a new Twitter account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-through-a-Smartphone-App"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Twitter-account-through-a-Smartphone-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Twitter account through a Smartphone App"></a>How to Create a Twitter account through a Smartphone App</h2><p> Android and iPhone users can use their devices to set up a new account on Twitter. Head over to Google Play or the App Store using your Smartphone and find the Twitter application. Once it appears in the search results, click on it to initiate the download and the installation process. After the Twitter app is successfully installed on your device, tap on it to start setting up your new account.</p><p> The process of creating a new account through a Smartphone app is the same as the one we described above. So, just insert your real name, username, email address and password and then tap on the SignUp button.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Multiple-Twitter-Accounts-With-the-Same-Email-Address"><a href="#How-to-Create-Multiple-Twitter-Accounts-With-the-Same-Email-Address" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Multiple Twitter Accounts With the Same Email Address"></a>How to Create Multiple Twitter Accounts With the Same Email Address</h2><p> Using the same email address for two Twitter accounts isn’t possible, because the platform will inform you that the email is already registered and that you have to enter a different email address. However, you can insert “+something” between your username and the @gmail extension to create email aliases which Gmail just regards the them as the same address and delivers the email directly to your nomal Gmail account. All emails from your new Twitter account will be sent to your original email address, even though you added the “+something” to it. This simple hack will allow you to manage multiple accounts from the same email address.</p><h2 id="Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web"><a href="#Can-you-log-in-to-more-than-one-Twitter-Account-at-a-time-via-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?"></a>Can you log in to more than one Twitter Account at a time via the web?</h2><p> Accessing a few different Twitter accounts from the same web browser isn’t an option since you first have to log out from one account in order to be able to log in to another one within the same web browser. Logging to multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously is only possible if you access the platform from different web browsers or if you are using <a class="link"   href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/" >TweetDeck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature that allows its users to manage two or more Twitter accounts from the same browser.</p><p> Was this article helpful?

Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1"></a>10. Chuck Norris’ Twitter handle is @ChuckFacts1</h2><p>Not only is he one of the world’s most popular action heroes a regular on the infomercial circuit, but he’s also a Twitter resource for “Chuck facts” that are guaranteed to please any cocktail party or water cooler.</p><p>“Love does not hurt. Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-can-i-post-a-video-between-twitter-and-tumblr/"><u>[New] In 2024, How Can I Post a Video Between Twitter and Tumblr?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-hilarious-threads-the-tweeter-treasury/"><u>In 2024, Hilarious Threads  The Tweeter Treasury</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-simplified-video-posts-on-twitter-and-tumblr/"><u>[New] Simplified Video Posts on Twitter and Tumblr</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-exclusive-twitter-gif-compiler-for-avid-scribes-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exclusive Twitter GIF Compiler for Avid Scribes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-uniting-conversations-across-platforms-twitter-vids-on-whatsapp/"><u>In 2024, Uniting Conversations Across Platforms  Twitter Vids on WhatsApp</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/seamless-acquisition-of-twitters-jokes-for-pc/"><u>Seamless Acquisition of Twitter's Jokes for PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-meme-masterpiece-wave/"><u>[New] Meme Masterpiece Wave</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-or-bypass-knox-enrollment-service-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-proplus-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Remove or Bypass Knox Enrollment Service On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-ways-to-transfer-contacts-from-apple-iphone-15-pro-to-iphone-quickly-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, 4 Ways to Transfer Contacts from Apple iPhone 15 Pro to iPhone Quickly | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/spoofing-life360-how-to-do-it-on-sony-xperia-1-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Spoofing Life360 How to Do it on Sony Xperia 1 V? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/sharpsight-screen-snag-report/"><u>SharpSight Screen Snag Report</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/gopro-vs-yi-4k-the-ultimate-battle-of-action-cam-innovation-in-23/"><u>GoPro Vs.

Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover-3" class="headerlink" title="7.

Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort-3"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort-3" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?). And it makes fun of Netflix just as much as it makes fun of us for binge-watching ridiculous stuff at midnight.</p><p>It connects with the comedians we all adore in between the important new-show announcements, ensuring that no subscriber’s chin is raised too high for their weekend plans:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-9.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3"><a href="#10-Chuck-Norris’-Twitter-handle-is-ChuckFacts1-3" class="headerlink" title="10.

Chuck Norris does,” is one of our favorite quotes. It’s difficult to choose a favorite tweet from this spoof account, which includes anything from coding jokes to “Only Chuck Norris can prevent forest fires.” More than ever, here’s a click of its most funniest one:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-10.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Any social media marketer has to understand how the Twitter algorithm works and how it may help them stand out from the crowd. Not everyone likes having an algorithm decide what they see on the internet. That’s why Twitter provides users the option of seeing the home timeline (also known as Top Tweets) or the Latest Tweets included in the <strong>Twitter funny videos</strong>. To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-uniting-twitter-and-facebook-through-shared-content/"><u>In 2024, Uniting Twitter and Facebook Through Shared Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-key-to-a-successful-tweet-including-aspect-ratio-details-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Key to a Successful Tweet  Including Aspect Ratio Details for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twitvidsync-ios-tool-to-seamlessly-save-twitter-vids/"><u>2024 Approved  TwitVidsync  IOS Tool to Seamlessly Save Twitter Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-to-twitter-share-videos-without-twitting-for-2024/"><u>YouTube to Twitter  Share Videos Without Twitting for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/interplatform-video-uploading-twitter-and-tumblr-synced/"><u>Interplatform Video Uploading  Twitter & Tumblr Synced</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/maximizing-viewing-tweeting-in-high-definition-hd-for-2024/"><u>Maximizing Viewing  Tweeting in High Definition (HD) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-gain-twitter-gifs-for-pc-download-made-simple/"><u>[New] In 2024, Gain Twitter Gifs for PC - Download Made Simple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-twitter-viewership-list-for-the-year/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Twitter Viewership List for the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-unresponsive-touch-screen-on-realme-11-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Unresponsive Touch Screen on Realme 11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-13-pro-passcode-4-easy-methods-with-or-without-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Passcode 4 Easy Methods (With or Without iTunes) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-entry-level-gaming-edit-suite-reviews/"><u>2024 Approved  Top Entry-Level Gaming Edit Suite Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-list-of-twitter-video-convertors/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate List of Twitter Video Convertors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fixing-persistent-pandora-crashes-on-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fixing Persistent Pandora Crashes on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-your-oneplus-11-5g-screen-to-pc-with-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror Your OnePlus 11 5G Screen to PC with Chromecast | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-leading-5-android-apps-for-professional-audio-post-production-for-2024/"><u>Updated Unveiling the Leading 5 Android Apps for Professional Audio Post Production for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-sculpt-your-story-in-fb-coverspace/"><u>In 2024, Sculpt Your Story in FB Coverspace</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-samsung-galaxy-f04-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data After Switching From Samsung Galaxy F04 to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The issue is that since Amazon Prime material is changed frequently, your favorite movie may not always be accessible. What can you do to ensure that you can watch your favorite films over and over again? While there aren’t many new movies uploaded to <strong>amazon prime video India Twitter</strong> at the moment, there’s always enough to see, including the last part in Sony’s animated Hotel Transylvania saga. The issue, it turns out, is picking among the streaming service’s hundreds of titles for <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-Twitter’s-Top-5-Most-Viewed-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos"></a>Part 1: Twitter’s Top 5 Most Viewed Videos</h2><p>Amazon Prime Video offers such a large collection of TV episodes and movies to choose from that deciding what’s genuinely worth watching may be difficult. That is why we have come! Aaron Sorkin’s Being the Ricardos, starring Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, the holiday rom-com series With Love, the sixth and final season of the sci-fi series The Expanse, the Riz Ahmed-starring alien movie Encounter, and more are among the most recent additions we’ve given our seal of approval to. If none of them appeal to you, our list of suggestions is very extensive, so we’re certain you’ll discover something else you like on <strong>Twitter amazon prime video</strong>.</p><h3 id="1-BTS-Dynamite"><a href="#1-BTS-Dynamite" class="headerlink" title="1. BTS Dynamite"></a>1. BTS Dynamite</h3><p>The most-watched video on the Twitter is none other than BTS video song Dynamite that’s in English and have a lot of views even on the Twitter. BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar). The group, however, said in many interviews that they preferred the song in its original form—they got the tape and enjoyed it, so they worked hard to learn the English lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-The-Underground-Railroad"><a href="#2-The-Underground-Railroad" class="headerlink" title="2. The Underground Railroad"></a>2. The Underground Railroad</h3><p>Moonlight, one of the finest Oscar-winning films of all time, was Barry Jenkins’ most recent production. Now, the filmmaker is back with The Underground Railroad, a limited series on Amazon that has already received acclaim for its strong narrative. Cora Randall, played by ‘Thuso Mbedu’, attempts to escape slavery by riding the titular underground railroad; however, in this other reality, the railroad is an actual railroad with trains and conductors, rather than just a network of safe homes and covert paths. The Underground Railroad offers a strong, sad narrative with a terrific ensemble cast and magnificent photography that’s better viewed over many hours rather than in one sitting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011"><a href="#3-Mission-Impossible-–-Ghost-Protocol-2011" class="headerlink" title="3.

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><p>Some arguments can be made for any of the Mission: Impossible films being the finest, but I’m here to end the debate once and for all: Ghost Protocol from 2011. Brad Bird, well renowned for his work with Pixar, offers a level of inventiveness to the action scenes that come from working in the infinitely creative world of animation. The image of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt mounting the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is spectacular even on the tiniest screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-The-Second-Family-Man"><a href="#4-The-Second-Family-Man" class="headerlink" title="4. The Second Family Man"></a>4. The Second Family Man</h3><p>The Family Man 2, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video, has wowed Twitter. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, and Samantha Akkineni play key roles in the program. Following the recent controversy in which it was said that The Family Man 2 harms Tamil sensibilities, fans are now appreciating Samantha Akkineni for her depiction of Raji, a Tamil rights activist. The Family Man 2 has already gotten a lot of positive feedback on Twitter, only a few hours after its premiere. Internet viewers are enamored with the show’s plot and all of the performers’ performances, particularly Samantha Akkineni’s. Manoj Bajpayee, Priyamani, Samantha Akkineni, and Sharib Hashmi play significant parts in the program. The program has progressed from Season 1 under the direction of Raj and DK, although not much has changed in terms of plot. While the program is receiving rave reviews from reviewers, the Internet can’t seem to get enough of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-The-Wheel-of-Time"><a href="#5-The-Wheel-of-Time" class="headerlink" title="5.

It ticks all the fantasy boxes: a prophecy about a strong young person who will rescue the world, extensive world-building that needs its map, and British accents.</p><p>While we wait for the Lord of the Rings TV program to arrive on Prime Video, there’s another epic fantasy show to enjoy in the meanwhile. Rosamund Pike plays a member of a powerful group of women who can wield magic in The Wheel of Time, which is likewise based on a series of novels. She joins a group of five young individuals on a round-the-world trip, thinking that one of them is the Dragon’s predicted reincarnation. Things take up in the fourth episode, and it’s certainly worth seeing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-5-most-viewed-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="viewed videos"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Amazon’s Twitter engagement, although mostly serving as a platform for content marketing rather than driving direct sales, still works to build and nurture an engaged community of consumers, encouraging as many as possible to join Prime. Q4 is often a big quarter for Amazon, and 2021 was no exception. Amazon got another 3% of British homes to sign up for Prime membership, bringing the total number of Prime subscribers to 56 percent. The same goes for the <strong>prime video twitter</strong> handle. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Prime Video accounted for 45 percent of new SVoD subscribers over the Christmas season. All of these films have one thing in common: the need to appeal to a larger audience on <strong>amazon prime video Twitter</strong>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Every month, Amazon Prime Video, the well-known streaming service, releases new series, movies, and documentaries that many people share across <strong>prime video Twitter</strong> with viewing.

BTS’s “Dynamite,” which was released at midnight Eastern Time on August 21, 2020, shattered records while also delivering much-needed comfort and pleasure to fans throughout the globe. “Dynamite” is accessible to a large audience since it is BTS’s first all-English tune. It’s easy to detect the shift from BTS’s regular lyrics and approach, which is to be anticipated (the track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar).

Eight years later, things seem as if they took the turn for the worse because the number of the platform’s monthly users is shrinking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitter-monthly-active-users.jpg"                                     ></p><p>In the last quarter of 2017, Twitter had only 330 million users, much less than Facebook that had 2,07 billion users or Instagram that had approximately 700 million users over that same period. Despite being easy to use and a powerful tool for reaching like-minded people or potential customers for your company’s products Twitter is slowly losing the reputation it once had.</p><h2 id="Why-Leave-Twitter"><a href="#Why-Leave-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Why Leave Twitter?"></a>Why Leave Twitter?</h2><p>At the end of the last year, the platform has increased the number of characters that can be used in a post, but this move did almost nothing to restore Twitter’s former glory. Celebrities getting caught up in Twitter wars, fake accounts and ultra-right-wing supporters have all contributed to the current state of affairs on Twitter. Most people simply decide to use another social network that doesn’t have the limitations imposed by a misguided company management and users that lack respect for everyone’s right to free speech.</p><h2 id="Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Best-5-Twitter-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Best 5 Twitter Alternatives"></a>Best 5 Twitter Alternatives</h2><p>The world’s fascination with Twitter was well-deserved because this social network offered unique features that actually foster public discussions and that can enable marketers to reach more users of the products they are advertising. Ten years ago, Twitter was one of the rare platforms that offered these opportunities, but today there are countless social media networks which provide the same service while making sure that their users are happy.</p><h4 id="1-Tumblr"><a href="#1-Tumblr" class="headerlink" title="1. Tumblr"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tumblr.com/" >Tumblr <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Tumblr is only a year younger than Twitter, and on April 8.2018 it hosted as many as 406.9 million blogs. Tumblr apps are available on both Android and iOS-based devices, which makes it available to the almost entire online community. The micro-blogging platform focuses on visual content more than on words, and for that reason, it has become an inexhaustible source of images that can be shared on downloaded.</p><p>The Tumbler’s editorial policy prevents open support for suicide or any form of self-harm, but it doesn’t place any other hard restrictions on the platform’s users. The visual nature of platform makes it a perfect tool for promotion of products and services. Tumblr is much more than a simple platform that lets you create photo and video collections because it provides the tools necessary for the online promotion of brands.</p><h4 id="2-Plurk"><a href="#2-Plurk" class="headerlink" title="2. Plurk"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.plurk.com/portal/" >Plurk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For years, Plurk offered the service that is nearly identical to the ones provided by Twitter, and it increased the number of character you can use in a post to 360 just a few years ago. Nearly 70% of all the traffic on the platform comes from Taiwan, so if you are targeting markets in Western Europe or the United States, Plurk may not be the best social network for you.</p><p>Plurk features a horizontal timeline and it lets you share pictures, videos or URLs for web-based articles. The platform stimulates its users to spend more time engaging with other Plurk members through the concept of Karma, which grants you access to more emoticons. This social network can be accessed from iPhones, Android devices or from PC or Mac computers.</p><h4 id="3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok"><a href="#3-Musical-ly-Now-it’s-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)"></a>3. Musical.ly (Now it’s TikTok)</h4><p>If you have never heard of this social network you may be getting a bit old, because most users of Musical.ly are aged between 13 and 18. Even though teenagers use it, the platform provides some interesting and amusing features that foster artistic expression and allow you to share your creative output with millions of people. Twitter users often share songs and videos posted on Musical.ly, so why not leave Twitter and start sharing your own creative content on this social media network.</p><p>Musical.ly lets you record songs, conversations, and all types of audio-visual content, but in order to access it, you must first install the app on your Android or iPhone device. Although it doesn’t offer the same features as Twitter, Musical.ly is still an interesting alternative for this declining social network.</p><h4 id="4-Gab-ai"><a href="#4-Gab-ai" class="headerlink" title="4. Gab.ai"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://gab.ai/" >Gab.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Free speech supporters are going to love using Gab.ai, a social network that has had their mobile app banned from both Google Play and the App Store, for failing to comply with their policies on adult content. Be it as it may, Gab.ai still offers shelter to people who think that hate speech or non-art related public nudity is somehow okay in the public domain. However, you really have to look for unsavory content, and most of the posts on the platform are dedicated to memes, pop culture or art.</p><p>Gab.ai doesn’t support ads, so it isn’t the best choice for companies and independent entrepreneurs who want to advertise their products or reach new markets. However, posts that get a lot of views and comments, do earn money, although the platform doesn’t support conventional online marketing techniques.</p><h4 id="5-Instagram"><a href="#5-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="5. Instagram"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>People who enjoy sharing a photo on Twitter from time to time should switch to Instagram because the platform provides much more photo editing features. In addition to amazing photo effects you can use on Instagram, you can post videos, which last up to sixty seconds or Stories that also last less than one minute. The platform’s aspect ratio restrictions have been lifted so, you can post square, horizontally and vertically oriented images or videos.</p><p>Even though you can access Instagram from a Mac or PC computer, you have to install the app for iPhones or Android phones in order to be able to post new content on Instagram. The social media platform supports sponsored content as well as ads, which makes it a perfect choice for everyone who wants to develop their business.</p><p>What is your favorite Twitter alternative?

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK" class="headerlink" title="6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK"></a>6. Elizabeth Windsor, @Queen UK</h3><p>The Royal Family is among the most popular in the world, yet the Queen of England is recognized for her leadership and intelligence more than her sense of humor.</p><p>While Prince William, Prince Harry, and Princess Kate have lightened up public appearances with dancing or casual conversation (karaoke with Taylor Swift, anyone? ), the Queen has stuck to a conventional approach to dealing with her people.</p><p>This emphasis on the conventional serves as the ideal launch for Twitter parody, with several highlights listed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-6.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover"><a href="#7-Sarcastic-Rover’s-Twitter-handle-is-SarcasticRover" class="headerlink" title="7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover"></a>7. Sarcastic Rover’s Twitter handle is @SarcasticRover</h3><p>This isn’t only a must-read for every space enthusiast. Even if it begins with a nice, phony Twitter name inspired by the actual Mars rover, Curiosity, it’s funny online fodder for anybody who pushes for a more science-literate community.</p><p>The tenacious space robot may or may not provide you with all the information about Mars, but it has the seal of approval from several space authorities: Bill Nye, SpaceX, and Space.com are all Twitter followers! At your leisure, savor its otherworldly innocence as shown here:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-7.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="8-Lord-Voldemort"><a href="#8-Lord-Voldemort" class="headerlink" title="8. @Lord Voldemort"></a>8. @Lord Voldemort</h3><p>At Hogwarts and on Twitter, the Dark Lord He Who Shall Not Be Named (of Harry Potter fame) is a force to be reckoned with. Thanks to its hilarious banter, the Dark Lord account has gained over 2.2 million followers. Quidditch jokes at the Super Bowl and Justin Bieber’s remarks below are two gems.</p><p>Sure, certain jokes need a Harry Potter fan to comprehend (Snape allusions abound), but many of the tweets are amusing even if you have just a passing familiarity of J.K. Rowling’s novels and films (particularly after a few swigs of butterbeer):</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-8.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke"><a href="#9-Netflix-Is-a-Joke-NetflixIsAJoke" class="headerlink" title="9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)"></a>9. Netflix Is a Joke (@NetflixIsAJoke)</h3><p>Who would say anything like that?! Netflix would.</p><p>This is a legitimate Netflix sister account devoted to the stand-up specials and comedy shows that it broadcasts for customers (get it?).

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored-3" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny-3" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015. There’s no lack of fodder to keep the Twitterverse focused on a galaxy far, far away, from asking Star Wars fans about their favorite character to reminiscing about some of his most horrific deeds on behalf of the Galactic Empire:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-5.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3"><a href="#6-Elizabeth-Windsor-Queen-UK-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

The number of the accounts you can follow on Twitter can be larger than the number of followers you have on your account by approximately 2000 accounts. For that reason, unfollowing accounts that don’t post often or share low-quality content is necessary in order to free up space for new people who are actually interested in what you have to say and offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unfollow-apps-twitter.jpg"                      alt="unfollow apps"                ></p><p>If you are having a tough time deciding which <strong>unfollow apps</strong> you should use, you are at the right place because in this article we are going to present top seven options that are currently available at the market.</p><p>Note: The following 7 apps are not in a particular order.</p><h2 id="7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter"><a href="#7-Best-Unfollow-Apps-for-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter"></a>7 Best Unfollow Apps for Twitter</h2><p>Apps featured below offer a wide array of options, so we recommend to choose the one that best fits your demands since there is no point in purchasing an app if you are going to use just a fraction of its full potential.</p><h4 id="1-SocialOopmph"><a href="#1-SocialOopmph" class="headerlink" title="1.

As Meme marketing is on top, which involves utilizing viral comedy to increase your brand’s exposure on social media, is a high-risk, high-reward game. The danger: embarrassingly falling flat on your face. This is certainly a bit concerning for brands. In the face of another round of loneliness, existential ambiguity, and Pringles, we could all use a little cheering up for <strong>Twitter’s top 100 video</strong>s.</p><p>It’s no secret that comedy is a great way to connect with customers, and this is particularly true for millennials, who are looking for individualized, meaningful experiences in form of hot funny videos on Twitter. When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world. But there’s also Twitter.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter"><a href="#Top-10-Funniest-Videos-on-Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter"></a>Top 10 Funniest Videos on Twitter</h2><p>Because Twitter isn’t only a platform for following celebrities, exchanging recommendations, and debating politics. It’s also still home to some of the internet’s funniest voices. Several literature-themed feeds will make you laugh out loud in a matter of seconds. The following are 10 of the finest.</p><h2 id="1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon"><a href="#1-Earnest-Pigeonway-CentralSqPigeon" class="headerlink" title="1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)"></a>1. Earnest Pigeonway (@CentralSqPigeon)</h2><p>Is Central Sq. Pigeon the internet’s most popular parody Twitter account? Certainly not… yet it’s one of Greater Boston’s funniest Twitter accounts.</p><p>Many people have heard of common squirrel, a satirical description of a mid-sized rodent’s everyday routine. I’d rather have Central Sq. Pigeon, formerly known as Earnest Pigeonway, than an ordinary squirrel any day. It helps that Central Sq. Pigeon is led by HubSpot designer Tyler Littwin, but the breathtaking insight into the inner workings of a city pigeon navigating the big bad world of Cambridge, Mass., wins the day in our opinion. Here’s a birds-eye perspective (pardon the pun) of what you may anticipate if you decide to follow him:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-1.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports"><a href="#2-Onion-Sports-Network-OnionSports" class="headerlink" title="2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)"></a>2. Onion Sports Network (@OnionSports)</h3><p>Because The Onion is the undisputed king of sarcasm and spoofs, it’s no wonder that their sports-related Twitter account has some of the funniest takeaways on current events and personalities.</p><p>Most sports-related Twitter accounts fluctuate in terms of frequency and quality or need extensive knowledge of the club or individual in question. However, @OnionSports covers a wide range of topics, ridiculing both die-hard fans and major sporting events, making it the go-to sports parody account to follow, particularly as the Super Bowl approaches:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-2.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored"><a href="#3-BoredElonMusk-—-Elon-Musk-is-bored" class="headerlink" title="3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored"></a>3. @BoredElonMusk — Elon Musk is bored</h3><p>Elon Musk’s exploits as a businessman and marketer have been extensively chronicled. The PayPal veteran and Tesla CEO are renowned for their crazy press briefings, creative ideas, and dynamic relationship with reality. Musk is long on vision and short on patience, which makes him an excellent candidate for a spoof Twitter account. From unveiling a high-speed Hyperloop between San Francisco and Los Angeles to a series of high-profile skirmishes with journalists, Musk is long on vision and short on patience.</p><p>For its drawings, humorous asides, and continuous commentary on all of Silicon Valley’s most overused terms, this ridiculous account is well worth a follow:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-3.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny"><a href="#4-SunnyinHawkins-—-Hawkins-is-always-sunny" class="headerlink" title="4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny"></a>4. @SunnyinHawkins — Hawkins is always sunny</h3><p>You don’t have to watch “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” to enjoy this Twitter account, but “Stranger Things” fans will appreciate this hilarious spin on one of their favorite Netflix episodes in particular.</p><p>Hawkins, the fictitious town in Indiana where “Stranger Things” is based, has been the site of a series of horrific occurrences centering on one group of inquisitive teenagers. It turns out that the cast’s chemistry is so endearing that you can’t help but envision them in a sitcom similar to FX’s “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Now you don’t have to imagine any longer:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/top-10-funniest-videos-on-twitter-4.jpg"                      alt="funniest videos"                ></p><h3 id="5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader"><a href="#5-Darth-Vader-Self-Portrait-DarthVader" class="headerlink" title="5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader"></a>5. Darth Vader Self-Portrait @DarthVader</h3><p>This person seems more like a passive-aggressive actor than the Lord of the Sith, dubbed as “Evil Orphan Ani” (Anakin coincidentally being Vader’s true name). It’s also rather amusing.</p><p>This spoof Twitter account has had enough to discuss (or rather, rage) about since the Star Wars series was relaunched in 2015.

When your target demographic’s concept of humor is a photoshopped image of Lord Farquaad from Shrek with the letter E pasted on top, delivering such experiences becomes more difficult. Of all, as book enthusiasts, we are well aware that we have the ideal means of escaping the outer world.

To put it another way, it’s either the Twitter algorithm or no algorithm hence you can use it for the humor you’re looking for.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/tiktok-trends-the-top-ten-tweets-shaping-social-media-for-2024/"><u>TikTok Trends  The Top Ten Tweets Shaping Social Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tube-tallies-counting-the-top-10-watched-videos-on-twit/"><u>2024 Approved  Tube Tallies  Counting the Top 10 Watched Videos on Twit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-keeping-up-with-aspect-ratios-for-twitter-content/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Keeping Up with Aspect Ratios for Twitter Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-high-impact-tweets-hot-videos-on-the-rise/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  High-Impact Tweets  Hot Videos on the Rise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-gif-grabbers-handbook-a-comprehensible-guide-to-downloading-twitter-gifs/"><u>2024 Approved  The GIF Grabber's Handbook  A Comprehensible Guide to Downloading Twitter GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-get-your-twitter-video-feed-ready-aspect-ratio-key/"><u>[Updated] Get Your Twitter Video Feed Ready  Aspect Ratio Key</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/tips-for-sending-tweets-video-content-via-whatsapp-for-2024/"><u>Tips for Sending Tweets' Video Content via WhatsApp for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-upload-tweets-no-retweets-on-mobile/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Upload Tweets - No Retweets on Mobile?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-vlog-victory-visions-2024/"><u>[Updated] Vlog Victory Visions 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-xiaomi-redmi-13c-to-laptop-without-usb-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from Xiaomi Redmi 13C to Laptop Without USB | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/master-the-art-of-browsing-and-playing-fb-videos-via-appletv/"><u>Master the Art of Browsing and Playing FB Videos via AppleTV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/sticker-perfection-ranking-the-top-10-apps-for-ios-and-android-photos-for-2024/"><u>Sticker Perfection  Ranking the Top 10 Apps for iOS and Android Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-content-creators-arena-vs-beta-studio-evolutionary-path/"><u>[Updated] Content Creator's Arena  Vs.
